# Fund can be infinitely locked in the OrderProcessor contract if external token admin pause the transfer or blacklist the OrderProcessor contract

## Summary

Fund can be infinitely locked in the OrderProcessor contract if external admin pause the transfer or blacklist the OrderProcessor contract

## Vulnerability Detail

In onchain contest readme:

> Q: Are the admins of the protocols your contracts integrate with (if any) TRUSTED or RESTRICTED?
Restricted (if any)

and

> Q: In case of external protocol integrations, are the risks of external contracts pausing or executing an emergency withdrawal acceptable? If not, Watsons will submit issues related to these situations that can harm your protocol's functionality.
Not acceptable - but likely not applicable

and the protocol intend to use USDC and USDT stablecoin

> Our own dShare tokens (BridgedERC20), USDC, and USDT

However, the external admin of the USDC can pause the transfer of the token or blacklist the OrderProcessor address

then all fund can be locked in the OrderProcessor contract

https://etherscan.io/address/0xa2327a938febf5fec13bacfb16ae10ecbc4cbdcf#code#L828

```solidity
    function transferFrom(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 value
    )
        external
        override
        whenNotPaused
        notBlacklisted(msg.sender)
        notBlacklisted(from)
        notBlacklisted(to)
        returns (bool)
    {
```

As we can see, the USDC admin can blocklist the OrderProcessor or pause the transfer

the USDT admin can pause the transfer infinitely

## Impact

Fund can be infinitely locked in the OrderProcessor contract if external admin pause the transfer or blacklist the OrderProcessor contract
