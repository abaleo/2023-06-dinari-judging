# Trading fees should round up in favor of the protocol to prevent value constantly leaking to traders

## Summary
Trading fees should always round up in favor of the protocol to prevent value constantly leaking from the treasury.

## Vulnerability Detail
[OrderFees.percentageFeeForValue()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dinari/blob/main/sbt-contracts/src/issuer/OrderFees.sol#L95) calls ``PrbMath.mulDiv18()`` which [rounds down to zero by default](https://github.com/PaulRBerg/prb-math/blob/main/src/Common.sol#L477).

[BuyOrderIssuer._fillBuyOrder()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dinari/blob/main/sbt-contracts/src/issuer/BuyOrderIssuer.sol#L179) calls ``PrbMath.mulDiv()`` which [rounds down to zero by default](https://github.com/PaulRBerg/prb-math/blob/main/src/Common.sol#L376).

This results in the fee being lower than it should be, meaning that the accumulated fees in the treasury will be less than they should be; value will effectively constantly be leaking out from the treasury.

While the value which leaks out on each transaction is small, this amount continually compounds over time as it happens continually. The more the system is used, the greater the cumulative value leak will be.

## Impact
Value will continuously leak out from the treasury; the greater the usage of the system & the longer the system runs, the greater the value leak becomes.

## Tool used
I learned this vulnerability using [Solodit.xyz](https://solodit.xyz/issues/different-rounding-directions-are-recommended-for-getting-buysell-info-cyfrin-sudoswap-markdown_) where it was reported as a Medium vulnerability in one of Cyfrin's audits.

## Recommendation
Trading fees should always round up in favor of the protocol to prevent value constantly leaking from the treasury. Uniswap v3's FullMath library contains [mulDivRoundingUp()](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/contracts/libraries/FullMath.sol#L113) and other FullMath libraries contain similar functions that explicitly allow rounding up.
