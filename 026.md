# Missing slippage protection in _requestOrderAccounting can lead to users funds loose

## Summary
When creating an order  in `_requestOrderAccounting` there is no **slippage** protection for user's funds. 

## Vulnerability Detail

- Keeper listen  to `OrderRequested` events  to buy the stock for user
- It can take more time than expected due off-chain reasons (point examples)
- One of the examples is a circuit break
- A user can loose funds if order takes to much time to fulfill off-chain 
- Even if the tif (Time in force) is GTC (Good until cancelled) should have a slippage protection of this cirscunstances

## Impact
- User will be affected by unintended and unhandled slippage, potentially affecting the funds they get back from the swap

## Code Snippet


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Allow a user to specify to key parameters `minOutAmount` in `_requestOrderAccounting` function. And make a check when keeper will execute the order.

The vulnerability in the system relates to the absence of slippage protection when creating an order in the _requestOrderAccounting function. This lack of protection exposes users to potential fund losses if the order takes an extended period of time to fulfill off-chain, even when the Time in Force (TIF) is set to Good Till Cancelled (GTC).

Vulnerability Detail:
The vulnerability stems from the fact that the system does not account for slippage when executing orders. Slippage refers to the difference between the expected price of an asset and the executed price due to market fluctuations or delays in execution. In this case, when a user creates an order, there is no mechanism in place to protect against slippage when the order is filled by a Keeper. This exposes users to the risk of receiving unintended and unhandled slippage, potentially resulting in losses of the funds they would receive from the swap.

Impact:
The impact of this vulnerability is that users are susceptible to financial losses if their orders take longer than anticipated to be fulfilled off-chain. External factors, such as circuit breaks or delays in Keeper execution, can cause the order to be filled at prices different from the expected price, leading to unfavorable outcomes for the user. Even if the order has a Time in Force of Good Till Cancelled, the absence of slippage protection leaves users vulnerable to potential fund losses and undermines the intended security and reliability of the system.
