- It can take more time than expected due off-chain reasons (point examples)
- One of the examples is a circuit break
- A user can loose funds if order takes to much time to fulfill off-chain 
- Even if the tif (Time in force) is GTC (Good until cancelled) should have a slippage protection of this cirscunstances
