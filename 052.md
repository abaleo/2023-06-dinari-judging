# Underflow in `_fillBuyOrder` leading to `fillOrder` always failing.

## Summary
After an `OrderRequest` has been done the `operator` calls `fillOrder` to complete the request, in the logic of this function an underflow will occur leading to the function always failing.
## Vulnerability Detail
Let's take the functions flow step by step.
`OrderProcessor.fillOrder` is called by the `operator`, order id is generated and after some other checks, the order state is updated. 
Note the remainingorder is updated here,
`uint256 remainingOrder = orderState.remainingOrder - fillAmount;`
 and the orderstate for this `orderid` is deleted if remainingOrder = 0
`delete _orders[orderId]`
Then `_fillOrderAccounting()` is called.
```solidity
 function fillOrder(OrderRequest calldata orderRequest, bytes32 salt, uint256 fillAmount, uint256 receivedAmount)
        external
        nonReentrant
        onlyRole(OPERATOR_ROLE)
    {
        // No nonsense
        if (fillAmount == 0) revert ZeroValue();
        bytes32 orderId = getOrderIdFromOrderRequest(orderRequest, salt);
        OrderState memory orderState = _orders[orderId];
        // Order must exist
        if (orderState.requester == address(0)) revert OrderNotFound();
        // Fill cannot exceed remaining order
        if (fillAmount > orderState.remainingOrder) revert AmountTooLarge();

        // Notify order filled
        emit OrderFill(orderId, orderRequest.recipient, fillAmount, receivedAmount);

        // Update order state
        uint256 remainingOrder = orderState.remainingOrder - fillAmount;
        // If order is completely filled then clear order state
        if (remainingOrder == 0) {
            // Notify order fulfilled
            emit OrderFulfilled(orderId, orderRequest.recipient);
            // Clear order state
            delete _orders[orderId];
            _numOpenOrders--;
        } else {
            // Otherwise update order state
            _orders[orderId].remainingOrder = remainingOrder;
            _orders[orderId].received = orderState.received + receivedAmount;
        }

        // Move tokens
        _fillOrderAccounting(orderRequest, orderId, orderState, fillAmount, receivedAmount);
    }

```

In `_fillOrderAccounting()`, `_fillBuyOrder()` is called, this function then updates `remainingOrder` again. The issue here is that `remainingorder` has already been updated previously making the value of `orderState.remainingOrder` already zero or if not deleted may be less than the `fillAmount`.
```solidity
uint256 remainingOrder = orderState.remainingOrder - fillAmount
```
Trying to perform this subtraction again will lead to an underflow and this being solidity version 0.8 will cause the function to fail.
```solidity
 function _fillBuyOrder(
        OrderRequest calldata orderRequest,
        bytes32 orderId,
        OrderState memory orderState,
        uint256 fillAmount,
        uint256 receivedAmount
    ) internal virtual {
        FeeState memory feeState = _feeState[orderId];
        uint256 remainingOrder = orderState.remainingOrder - fillAmount;
        // If order is done, close order and transfer fees
        if (remainingOrder == 0) {
// More Code...
 }
```

## Impact
The function `fillOrder()` will always fail leading to orders never being completed.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The line below is unnecessary and should be removed from `BuyOrderIssuer._fillBuyOrder()` since `remainingOrder` has already been updated.
```solidity
uint256 remainingOrder = orderState.remainingOrder - fillAmount
```
