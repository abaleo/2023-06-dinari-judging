# OrderId is not unique can lead to DOS for users/ damage backend

## Summary
OrderId is not unique can lead to DOS for users/ damage backend
## Vulnerability Detail
OrderId is created by hashing salt and orderRequest. OrderId is duplicated if users using the same params again.
Duplicated orderId will get reverted until the original orderId got fulfill  
## Impact
This can lead to DOS if user genuinely want to buy/sell twice or more time with the same inputs and the operator is not fulfill enough the original orderId which will happen likely
Moreover, since orderId is not unique, backend can get messed up and think two order is the same if we not handle it very carefully
