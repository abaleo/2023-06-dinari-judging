# `requestOrder` lack of slippage (mint & burn)

## Summary

`requestOrder` lack of slippage (mint & burn)

## Vulnerability Detail

User call `requestOrder` believing Operator will `fillOrder` in short time. Issue might happen when Operator delayed to fulfil the order, meanwhile price has change to unfavourable position for user to buy (or sell)

```js
File: OrderProcessor.sol
46:     // Specification for an order
47:     struct OrderRequest {
48:         // Recipient of order fills
49:         address recipient;
50:         // Bridged asset token
51:         address assetToken;
52:         // Payment token
53:         address paymentToken;
54:         // Amount of incoming order token to be used for fills
55:         uint256 quantityIn;
56:         // price enquiry for the request
57:         uint256 price;
58:     }
```

Lack of slippage check from `requestOrder` will make user's order will be fulfilled in an undesirable price or time. Since Order is created with `GTC` the only way to stop users 'pending' order is through `requestCancel` which it also need to wait until operator execute it.

In a scenario where a sudden price movement of `dShares`, while user is not aware of this, will put user into losing state. For example:

1. User create `requestOrder` when 1 `dShares` is 10 USDC thinking it will never be below 5 USDC and above 20 USDC.
2. If there is a sudden price change resulting 1 `dShares` now 1 USDC, user might think this is dumped, and don't want to fill the order. Or in reverse if the `dShares` now 100 USDC, user may think it's overprice.
3. Since the Order doesn't have any slippage protection mechanism, the previous condition will happen.

```js
File: BuyOrderIssuer.sol
121:         // Construct order
122:         order = Order({
123:             recipient: orderRequest.recipient,
124:             assetToken: orderRequest.assetToken,
125:             paymentToken: orderRequest.paymentToken,
126:             // Buy order
127:             sell: false,
128:             // Market order
129:             orderType: OrderType.MARKET,
130:             assetTokenQuantity: 0,
131:             // Hold fees back from order amount
132:             paymentTokenQuantity: orderRequest.quantityIn - totalFees,
133:             price: orderRequest.price,
134:             // Good until cancelled
135:             tif: TIF.GTC,
136:             // Emit fees held back from order amount
137:             fee: totalFees
138:         });
```

This issue also open on the other side, selling (burning) dShares, which doesn't have any slippage protection.

## Impact

User's order will fulfilled in undesirable price, losing user's asset
