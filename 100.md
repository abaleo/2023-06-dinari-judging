# Possible DOS in Orderprocessor.requestOrder()

## Summary
requestOrder() can be DOSed

## Vulnerability Detail
In Orderprocessor.requestOrder(), salt is generated by a user. Exposure of the salt value generated by a user in the mempool allows other malicious users to replicate the value and create identical orders. As a result, the original user is unable to successfully create their own order.

## Impact
User is unable to make orders
