# `_cancelOrderAccounting` in `SellOrderPeocessor` contract will revert if the `orderRequest.recipient` is a blacklisted account in `BridgedERC20` dShare token

## Summary

`_cancelOrderAccounting` in `SellOrderPeocessor` contract will revert if the `orderRequest.recipient` is a blacklisted account in `BridgedERC20` dShare token

## Vulnerability Detail

- In `SellOrderProcessor` contract: users are selling their dShare tokens (`BridgedERC20`) for `paymentToken` in return (which is USDC or USDT).

- But dShare token (`BridgedERC20`) has a `_beforeTokenTransfer` hook that checks if the sender or the receiver of the tokens is blacklisted account or not, if blacklisted; the transfer will revert.

- And since there's no check when creating a `sellOrder` if the `orderRequest.recipient` (the one who will receive the remaining dShare tokens when the sellOrder is cancelled) is a blacklisted account in `BridgedERC20` dShare token or not: then when the operator tries to cancel the sell order by calling `cancelOrder` function in `OrderProcessor` contract; the `_cancelOrderAccounting` function will revert if the recipient is a blacklisted account.

## Impact

This will prevent operators from deleting the invalid and un-fulfillabl sellOrders, or deleting the sellOrder as per the request of `OrderState.requester` (the one who adds the order) , so the `assetToken` (and `paymentToken` if the order is partially filled) of the order paid by the `OrderState.requester` will be stuck (unless manually sent to the requester).

## Code Snippet

- In `SellOrderPeocessor.sol`/ `_cancelOrderAccounting` function: [Line 150](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dinari/blob/4851cb7ebc86a7bc26b8d0d399a7dd7f9520f393/sbt-contracts/src//issuer/SellOrderProcessor.sol#L150)

```solidity
 Line 150: IERC20(orderRequest.assetToken).safeTransfer(orderRequest.recipient, refund);
```

- In `BridgedERC20.sol`/ `_beforeTokenTransfer` hook: [L127-L136](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dinari/blob/4851cb7ebc86a7bc26b8d0d399a7dd7f9520f393/sbt-contracts/src/BridgedERC20.sol#L127-L136)

```solidity
    function _beforeTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256) internal virtual override {
        // Restrictions ignored for minting and burning
        // If transferRestrictor is not set, no restrictions are applied
        if (from == address(0) || to == address(0) || address(transferRestrictor) == address(0)) {
            return;
        }


        // Check transfer restrictions
        transferRestrictor.requireNotRestricted(from, to);
    }
```

- In `TransferRestrictor .sol`/ `requireNotRestricted` function: [L53-L59](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dinari/blob/4851cb7ebc86a7bc26b8d0d399a7dd7f9520f393/sbt-contracts/src/TransferRestrictor.sol#L53-L59)

```solidity
    function requireNotRestricted(address from, address to) external view virtual {
        // Check if either account is restricted
        if (blacklist[from] || blacklist[to]) {
            revert AccountRestricted();
        }
        // Otherwise, do nothing
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

In `OrderProcessor` contract/`requestOrder` function:
check if the `orderRequest.recipient` is not dShare token blacklisted account before adding a sellOrder to the platform.
