# Cancelation of order will fail If the recipient is added to the USDC blacklist.

## Summary
`cancelOrder()` will send the  USDC to the recipient, if the recipient is added to the USDC blacklist, then `cancelOrder()` will not work.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `cancelOrder` function cancels an order and sends the escrowed tokens to the user .
Consider a scenario where if the operator intends to call `cancelOrder` function to cancel the order, a malicious recipient can block the address from receiving USDC by adding it to the USDC blacklist (e.g. by doing something malicious with that address, etc.), which prevents the Protocol from canceling the Order.

## Impact

A malicious recipient may prevent the protocol from cancelling malicious orders .
## Code Snippet
The inherited `cancelOrder` function from `OrderProcessor.sol` in `SellOrderProcessor.sol`  will fail due to the circumstancess 

This is where the transaction fails : 
```solidity 
  IERC20(orderRequest.assetToken).safeTransfer(orderRequest.recipient, refund);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Instead of sending tokens directly to recipient, consider storing the number of tokens in variables and having the  recipient claim it later
