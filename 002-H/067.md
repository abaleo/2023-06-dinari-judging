# Front-running of restrict() function

## Summary
It's possible to prevent funds from being restricted by the transfer restriction by front running

## Vulnerability Detail
Malicious users that should be restricted can run a script to monitor the mempool and listen for a transaction that calls restrict() for their addresses, and front run the transaction that calls restrict() with a higher gas fee to transfer their tokens away before they are added to the blacklist, effectively preventing their funds from being restricted

## Impact
Malicious users that should be restricted can prevent their funds to be restricted by front running
