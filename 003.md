# User can submit buy order that starts at a net loss due to double sided fees

## Summary
When a user issues a buy order, there is check to ensure that the input value of the order exceeds the fees. However this check only considers the fee in one-direction (the buy direction) and doesn't include the fee in the sell direction, which is necessary to realise any profits.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user issues an order with Dinari, there is both a fixed fee and a percentage fee. This fee is calculated based on the input/output value of the payment token. Therefore, it is imperative that there is a check that the user submits an order with a value greater than at least the fixed fee. This check exists in the `BuyOrderIssuer.sol` contract in `_requestOrderAccounting`:

```solidity
uint256 totalFees = flatFee + percentageFee;
// Fees must not exceed order input value
if (totalFees >= orderRequest.quantityIn) revert OrderTooSmall();
```

However, the issue with this check is that it only accounts for the fee of the buy order, not the sell order that is required to realise the profits of any trade. The sell order also charges the same flat fee as can be seen in `_requestOrderAccounting` in `SellOrderProcessor.sol`:

```solidity
        // Accumulate initial flat fee obligation
        _feesEarned[orderId] = getFlatFeeForOrder(orderRequest.paymentToken);
```

As a result, if a user submits an order that is greater than 1x flat fee but less than 2x totalFee, their order actually starts at a net loss. This should be prevented with an additional check to protect users.

## Impact
A user is able to submit a buy order that starts at a net loss due to fees in both the buy and sell direction. Since the user will always need to perform 2 orders to realise a profit (both the buy and sell side), they should be protected from opening orders that are too small.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I would suggest that the minimum order quantity check is updated to the following:

```diff
diff --git a/sbt-contracts/src/issuer/BuyOrderIssuer.sol b/sbt-contracts/src/issuer/BuyOrderIssuer.sol
index 42dc2c9..a7b3ab5 100644
--- a/sbt-contracts/src/issuer/BuyOrderIssuer.sol

         (uint256 flatFee, uint256 percentageFee) = getFeesForOrder(orderRequest.paymentToken, orderRequest.quantityIn);
         uint256 totalFees = flatFee + percentageFee;
         // Fees must not exceed order input value
-        if (totalFees >= orderRequest.quantityIn) revert OrderTooSmall();
+        if (orderRequest.quantityIn <= totalFees * 2) revert OrderTooSmall();
 
         // Initialize fee state for order
         _feeState[orderId] = FeeState({remainingPercentageFees: percentageFee, feesEarned: flatFee});
```

This is actually extra safe as the absolute value of the percentage fee will be smaller on the sell side (since the buy side fees have already been charged).
