# Users' output sometimes will be different than what they expect due to incorrect view function

## Summary
Users' output sometimes will be different than what they expect due to incorrect view function
## Vulnerability Detail
Whenever a user would like to know how much it would take for him to get a specific amount of tokens he will call `getInputValueForOrderValue` but when he will call `requestOrder` with those params result might be different that the one he requested.

Per EIP 4626's Security Considerations (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626)

>Finally, EIP-4626 Vault implementers should be aware of the need for specific, opposing rounding directions across the different mutable and view methods, as it is considered most secure to favor the Vault itself during calculations over its users:
If (1) it’s calculating how many shares to issue to a user for a certain amount of the underlying tokens they provide or (2) it’s determining the amount of the underlying tokens to transfer to them for returning a certain amount of shares, it should round down.
If (1) it’s calculating the amount of shares a user has to supply to receive a given amount of the underlying tokens or (2) it’s calculating the amount of underlying tokens a user has to provide to receive a certain amount of shares, it should round up.

    function recoverInputValueFromRemaining(uint256 remainingValue) external view returns (uint256) {
        // Get base percentage fee rate
        uint64 _percentageFeeRate = percentageFeeRate;
        // If percentage fee rate is zero, return input unchanged
        if (_percentageFeeRate == 0) {
            return remainingValue;
        }
        // inputValue = percentageFee + remainingValue
        // inputValue = remainingValue / (1 - percentageFeeRate)
        return PrbMath.mulDiv(remainingValue, _ONEHUNDRED_PERCENT, _ONEHUNDRED_PERCENT - _percentageFeeRate);
    }
