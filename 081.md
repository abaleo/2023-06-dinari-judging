# `DirectBuyIssuer`'s getOrderEscrow amount didn't updated after `_fillOrderAccounting`

## Summary

`DirectBuyIssuer`'s getOrderEscrow amount didn't updated after `_fillOrderAccounting`

## Vulnerability Detail

By design protocol can `takeEscrow` with max escrow amount of user's asset based on the amount of `getOrderEscrow[orderId]`. This `getOrderEscrow[orderId]` is set on `_requestOrderAccounting` when `requestOrder` is called.

```js
File: DirectBuyIssuer.sol
109:         // Initialize escrow tracking for order
110:         getOrderEscrow[orderId] = order.paymentTokenQuantity;
```

when `takeEscrow` called, the escrow amount will be deducted with the amount Operator take.

```js
File: DirectBuyIssuer.sol
64:         // Update escrow tracking
65:         getOrderEscrow[orderId] = escrow - amount;
```

Issue will arise when `fillOrder` is called, which will call:

```js
File: DirectBuyIssuer.sol
113:     /// @inheritdoc OrderProcessor
114:     function _fillOrderAccounting(
115:         OrderRequest calldata orderRequest,
116:         bytes32 orderId,
117:         OrderState memory orderState,
118:         uint256 fillAmount,
119:         uint256 receivedAmount
120:     ) internal virtual override {
121:         // Can't fill more than payment previously taken from escrow
122:         uint256 escrow = getOrderEscrow[orderId];
123:         if (fillAmount > orderState.remainingOrder - escrow) revert AmountTooLarge();
124:
125:         // Buy order accounting
126:         _fillBuyOrder(orderRequest, orderId, orderState, fillAmount, receivedAmount);
127:     }
```

The issue here is this `_fillOrderAccounting` does not update the `getOrderEscrow[orderId]`. It should update by decreasing the escrow with `fillAmount`.

If the `getOrderEscrow[orderId]` is not updated, the `takeEscrow` no can take more than it should. It's not about operator will not do that (taking escrow more than it supposed to have), but this open for accounting error and protocol design of how escrow works might invalidate because of this issue.

If `fillOrder` is called before `takeEscrow` there will be a case where user's balance will be taken even though the fillOrder already partially filled, or completed.

## Impact

Wrong escrow balance accounting open for Operator `takeEscrow` more than it supposed to have (even though it's trusted entity), which is not expected by protocol. Also, if the fillOrder is called before takeEscrow, it's open for double spend user's asset.
