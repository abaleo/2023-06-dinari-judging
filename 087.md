# _distributeProceeds incorrectly handles fees to treasury in some cases

## Summary
When a user's sell order is filled or (partially) cancelled, proceeds and collections are calculated and sent to the user and treasury if > 0. The problem is that, with partially filled orders that are being cancelled, if fees > totalReceived, the contract sends a value to treasury that is lower than it should be. 
## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dinari/blob/main/sbt-contracts/src/issuer/SellOrderProcessor.sol#L154-L175

There are three scenario's in which the user could end in this function: 
1. totalReceived > feesEarned
2. totalReceived == feesEarned
3. totalReceived < feesEarned

If we take the last scenario and ,for example, the user cancels a partially filled order where orderState.remainingOrder = 50, totalReceived = 10 and feesEarned = 20, the `else` statement will be triggered (flow = `_cancelOrderAccounting()` -> `_distributeProceeds`)
This will set `collection = totalReceived` and send that value to the treasury and the orderState.remainingOrder are refunded to the user. Meaning the user has paid less than he should have while having funds to pay for it which leads to a bad debt of the protocol.
## Impact
User not paying the full amount of fees

Manual Review

## Recommendation
When an partially order is cancelled and totalReceived < feesEarned, deduct totalReceived from feesEarned and deduct that value from `refund`. 
`refund = orderState.remainingOrder - (feesEarned - totalReceived)`
