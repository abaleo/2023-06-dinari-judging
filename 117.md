# Escrow amount balance is not decreased after `fillOrder` in `DirectBuyIssuer`

## Summary

Escrow amount balance is not decreased after `fillOrder` in `DirectBuyIssuer`

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `DirectBuyIssuer` contract, the escrow amount (getOrderEscrow) is not updated (decreased) when calling `fillOrder`. It supposed to be decreased by the `fillAmount`, because the logic here is that `uint256 remainingOrder = orderState.remainingOrder - fillAmount;`.

Escrow balance (`getOrderEscrow[orderId]`) is initially set to the `paymentTokenQuantity`. This escrow amount serves as the maximum value that the Operator can withdraw when invoking the `takeEscrow` function.

When a user's order is filled, whether partially or as a whole, the `_fillOrderAccounting` function is executed to verify if the fill amount is less than or equal to the difference between the remaining order and the escrow (`remainingOrder - escrow`). If this condition is met, the `_fillBuyOrder` function is called from the `BuyOrderIssuer` contract to mint the corresponding dShares.

```js
File: DirectBuyIssuer.sol
113:     /// @inheritdoc OrderProcessor
114:     function _fillOrderAccounting(
115:         OrderRequest calldata orderRequest,
116:         bytes32 orderId,
117:         OrderState memory orderState,
118:         uint256 fillAmount,
119:         uint256 receivedAmount
120:     ) internal virtual override {
121:         // Can't fill more than payment previously taken from escrow
122:         uint256 escrow = getOrderEscrow[orderId];
123:         if (fillAmount > orderState.remainingOrder - escrow) revert AmountTooLarge();
124:
125:         // Buy order accounting
126:         _fillBuyOrder(orderRequest, orderId, orderState, fillAmount, receivedAmount);
127:     }
```

Here we can see the `getOrderEscrow[orderId]` is still not updated by the (partial or complete) fillOrder, it supposed to decrease escrow with fillAmount. The protocol need to update the value as the escrow amount `getOrderEscrow[orderId]` is used in different function, like `returnEscrow` and `_cancelOrderAccounting`.

```js
File: DirectBuyIssuer.sol
130:     function _cancelOrderAccounting(OrderRequest calldata order, bytes32 orderId, OrderState memory orderState)
131:         internal
132:         virtual
133:         override
134:     {
135:         // Prohibit cancel if escrowed payment has been taken and not returned or filled
136:         uint256 escrow = getOrderEscrow[orderId];
137:         if (orderState.remainingOrder != escrow) revert UnreturnedEscrow();
138:
139:         // Standard buy order accounting
140:         super._cancelOrderAccounting(order, orderId, orderState);
141:     }
```

For example, if the escrow balance is not updated (after fillOrder), the cancel function statement `orderState.remainingOrder != escrow` (assuming no `takeEscrow` or `takeEscrow` and returned) will be true thus preventing the cancel, because in `fillOrder` the `remainingOrder` is updated (decreased)

```js
File: OrderProcessor.sol
289:         // Update order state
290:         uint256 remainingOrder = orderState.remainingOrder - fillAmount;
```

## Impact

Escrow balance is not correctly calculated, resulting accounting error, and may prevent canceling the order

## Recommendation

Update (decrease) the escrow balance when `fillOrder` is called
