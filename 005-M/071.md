# Operators can take escrow of any cancelled order

## Summary

Operators can take escrow of any cancelled order

## Vulnerability Detail

In `DirectBuyIssuer` contract/`_cancelOrderAccounting` function:
Since the escrow of the order is not deleted when cancelling the order;any operator can take the full amount of the escrow of any cancelled order.

## Impact

The protocol will be losing from its `paymentToken` as escrows payment for deleted orders,which will lead to orders not being able to be filled or cancelled due to insufficient balance of `paymentToken` (USDC or USDT).

## Code Snippet

- In `DirectBuyIssuer.sol`/ `_cancelOrderAccounting` function: [L130-L141](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dinari/blob/4851cb7ebc86a7bc26b8d0d399a7dd7f9520f393/sbt-contracts/src/issuer/DirectBuyIssuer.sol#L130-L141)

```solidity
    function _cancelOrderAccounting(OrderRequest calldata order, bytes32 orderId, OrderState memory orderState)
        internal
        virtual
        override
    {
        // Prohibit cancel if escrowed payment has been taken and not returned or filled
        uint256 escrow = getOrderEscrow[orderId];
        if (orderState.remainingOrder != escrow) revert UnreturnedEscrow();

        // Standard buy order accounting
        super._cancelOrderAccounting(order, orderId, orderState);
    }
```

## Tool used

## Recommendation
