# Incorrect function flow when using DirectBuyIssuer to fill order.

## Summary
When using `DirectBuyIssuer.sol` to take an escrow and fill an order, `BuyOrderIssuer._fillOrderAccounting` is called instead of `DirectBuyIssuer._fillOrderAccounting`.
This skips all the accounting regarding escrow.
## Vulnerability Detail
The contract architecture of `DirectBuyIssuer.sol` is al follows:
OrderProcessor
          |
BuyOrderIssuer
          |
DirectBuyIssuer

The flow of filling an order = `takeEscrow()` -> `OrderProcessor.fillOrder()`, which calls `BuyOrderIssuer_fillOrderAccounting` and `BuyOrderIssuer_fillBuyOrder`. 

This skips the following code which does the accounting when an escrow is involved:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dinari/blob/4851cb7ebc86a7bc26b8d0d399a7dd7f9520f393/sbt-contracts/src/issuer/DirectBuyIssuer.sol#L122-L123

The test cases in `DirectBuyIssuerTest` also do not check for the escrow values, meaning it has not been tested weather the correct function is being called.
## Impact
Escrow of an account is not updated meaning multiple escrows can be taken while exceeding the users true escrow value.

POC: 
I've recreated the structure to check which function is being called.
```solidity
abstract contract orderProcessor {
   uint public number = 0;

   function go() public {
     fill();
   }
   function fill() public virtual {}
}

contract BuyProcessor is orderProcessor {
   function fill() public virtual override{
   number = 5;
   }
}

contract DirectBuy is BuyProcessor {
   function fill() public virtual override  {
   number = 10;
   }
}
```

In this case, `number = 5` while it should be 10

## Recommendation
Check if an escrow is taken for the order and explicitly call `DirectBuy._fillOrderAccounting`
