# Any user can close any other user's position

## Summary
A malicious user can cause any other user to lose funds by executing trades on their behalf in less than favorable conditions.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `SellOrderProcessor.sol` contract there are no checks to ensure that the person executing `requestOrder()` is the owner of the position.

Any user can close positions for any other user without their consent causing potential loss of funds.

## Impact
The owner of the position can lose funds if the execution occurs at a price lower than their purchase price. 
loss = ((initial-sellPrice)+fees)

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a check in the `requestOrder()` function  to require that the execution in `SellOrderProcessor.sol` is done by the recipient of the order.
```solidity
if (orderRequest.recipient != msg.sender) revert Error();
```
