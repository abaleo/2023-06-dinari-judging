# # Orders can be manipulated to make it not profitable to close

## Summary

If there is 1 wei remaining in the order, it may not be profitable for the operator to close this order if the transaction costs is greater than the fees accumulated from the trade.

## Vulnerability Detail

1. Create an order.
2. Operator partially fills it.
3. Cancel remaining order and leave only 1 wei in it.

If fees accumulated from the filled order is less than the transaction fee, game theory states that the most +ev approach is to leave the order open because closing the order (either by closing or filling the remaining 1 wei) will cause the operator to lose money.

Note that there is not enough information on how the operator partially fills an order / executing the trade offline w/ their brokerage so I will assume the worst i.e. that this is a potential vulnerability.

## Impact

Operators will not be able to get paid.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Set a minimum order size and check that order size have to be at least above this amount.
