# Improper storage gaps placement may lead to collisions

## Summary
The project contains contracts that inherits from upgradeable contracts. They make use of storage gaps but these gaps are implemented incorrectly, in case of upgrade that adds another state variables in parent contracts the collision in inevitable.
Note, that even if we assume that admin is trusted, and no insecure upgrade will be made, this will still at least impair the ability to freely upgrade the contracts after deployment, because the ability to freely add new state variables will be lost in comparison to a situation when there are proper storage gaps. 

## Vulnerability Detail
OrderProcessor is Upgradeable.
SellOrderProcessor inherits from OrderProcessor
DirectBuyIssuer inherits from BuyOrderIssuer which inherits from OrderProcessor

The OrderProcessor contract's last storage slot is occupied by variable [_orders](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dinari/blob/main/sbt-contracts/src/issuer/OrderProcessor.sol#L124) After it, a gap should be present, because if during upgrade the implementation is changed and another variable is placed there after _orders, then inheriting contracts' storage will be overwritten with it. But there is no gap. As you can observe in `storage/` directory, there are variables after _orders like `feeState`, `getOrderEscrow` or `feesEarned`. If they are overwritten during an upgrade, the core utilities of the protocol may stop functioning properly. This is because, the parent storage is laid out before the child storage. More about that can be read [here](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/upgradeable#storage_gaps). 

## Impact
Key state variables may be overwritten leading to breaking the protocol if an upgrade is performed.

## Code Snippet
Below listing presents OrderProcessor.sol state variables. There is no gap declared after end of the state varaibles block.
```solidity
    /// ------------------ State ------------------ ///

    /// @notice Address to receive fees
    address public treasury;

    /// @notice Fee specification contract
    IOrderFees public orderFees;

    /// @dev Are orders paused?
    bool public ordersPaused;

    /// @dev Total number of active orders. Onchain enumeration not supported.
    uint256 private _numOpenOrders;

    /// @dev Active orders
    mapping(bytes32 => OrderState) private _orders;
```

Below listing is content of file [SellOrderProcessor.txt](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dinari/blob/main/sbt-contracts/storage/SellOrderProcessor.txt), where its visible that there is no gap after `_orders` and there is an immediate variable `_feesEarned` coming from child contract present after it. The latter is vulnerable to collision if storage of OrderProcessor will be expanded.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Place a storage gap at the very end of any upgradeable parent contract storage declaration block. Alternatively, move storage declaration to just one contract instead of splitting it over multiple inheriting contracts.
