# Tokens can be transferred by malicious users despite restrictions

## Summary
In the protocol, a malicious user who possesses asset tokens can still spend them even if they have been blacklisted by an admin.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `TransferRestrictor` contract is responsible for enforcing transfer restrictions in the protocol. 
However, the function [TransferRestrictor::restrict](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dinari/blob/main/sbt-contracts/src/TransferRestrictor.sol#L37-L40) can be monitored by a malicious user who can front-run transactions. This allows them to exploit the following scenario:
1. Eve holds some `BridgedERC20` tokens.
2. The owner of the `TransferRestrictor` decides that Eve is malicious and should have her token balance restricted. Consequently, the owner calls the [TransferRestrictor::restrict](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dinari/blob/main/sbt-contracts/src/TransferRestrictor.sol#L37-L40) function.
3. Anticipating this action, Eve monitors the mempool and front-runs the transaction by initiating a `BridgedERC20::transfer` to another address under her control.
4. Although her original address is now restricted, Eve can still transfer or sell her tokens because the new address she transferred them to is not restricted.

According to the whitepaper, a malicious user should not be able to send tokens - `A blacklisted account will not be able to send or receive tokens.`

## Impact
This vulnerability allows malicious users to bypass the [BridgedERC20::_beforeTokenTransfer](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dinari/blob/main/sbt-contracts/src/BridgedERC20.sol#L135) check. Consequently, they can carry out malicious actions against the protocol.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this issue, it is recommended to execute the [TransferRestrictor::restrict](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dinari/blob/main/sbt-contracts/src/TransferRestrictor.sol#L37-L40) transaction through a private mempool or redesign the process to prevent front-running.
