# Lack of Storage Gap in Upgradable Proxy Pattern in OrderProcessor

## Summary
The smart contract system includes the contracts `OrderProcessor`, `BuyOrderIssuer`, and `SellOrderProcessor`, where the latter two inherit from the `OrderProcessor`. The contracts are implemented as a UUPS upgradeable proxy. However, there's currently no storage gap in the `OrderProcessor` contract, limiting the possibility of adding new state variables in the future.

## Vulnerability Detail
When using an upgradeable contract structure, it's common to include a storage gap. This reserved space allows the contract to be upgraded without causing clashes in the storage layout.

In the case of the `OrderProcessor` contract, there's currently no storage gap. If an upgrade to `OrderProcessor` introduces new state variables, it might cause a conflict with the variables defined in `BuyOrderIssuer` and `SellOrderIssuer`, which inherit from `OrderProcessor`. This poses a limitation for future updates and upgrades to the contract.
