# The percentage fee can vary during the life of a sell order

## Summary
Sell orders can be filled partially. Upon each partial fill, the percentage fee is calculated based on the current fee percentage set in the `OrderFees.sol` contract. Therefore, any change to the percentage fee rate retroactively applies to all active sell orders.

## Vulnerability Detail
Buy orders do not suffer from this issue, as they have the percentage fee taken out upon requesting the order. This ensures that future changes to the percentage fee rate do not affect active orders.

A user can create a sell order while the percentage fee is **1%**. If Dinari changes it so that the percentage fee is now **10%**, then it will apply to the already active order.

## Impact
- Users will be exposed to different percentage fees than expected when requesting the order

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The percentage fee rate should be stamped when the sell order is requested. Future changes to the current percentage fee should not affect existing orders.
