# Front Run of restrict() Function

## Summary

Front Run of restrict() Function

## Vulnerability Detail

A malicious user could monitor the mempool to detect if a transaction enforcing transfer restrictions on their address is present. If such a transaction is identified, they can exploit the situation by sending a transaction with a higher gas fee to transfer their funds, thereby preventing their funds from being subject to the transfer restrictions imposed by the `restrict()` function.

## Impact

Malicious users can bypass the transfer restrictions.

## Code Snippet

```solidity=!
function restrict(address account) external onlyOwner {
    blacklist[account] = true;
    emit Restricted(account);
}
```
