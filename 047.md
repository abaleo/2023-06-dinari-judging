- From the whitepaper-v1 "Dinari dShares maintains 1-to-1 backing in real-time .."

- from Chat gpt
```diff
Oil futures can be classified as securities. Futures contracts, including oil futures, are financial instruments that represent an agreement to buy or sell a specific quantity of a commodity (such as oil) at a predetermined price and future date.
```
- e.g.[US oil prices turn negative](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52350082)

so the `Dinari dShares` price could be a negative price

## Vulnerability Detail
users are not able to buy or sell their `Dinari dShares` with a negative price. du to `uint256` of the price variable in the `OrderRequest` struct 

```solidity
File: OrderProcessor.sol
46:     // Specification for an order
47:     struct OrderRequest {
           /*SNIP*/
56:         // price enquiry for the request
57:         uint256 price;
58:     }

```

## Impact
- Users are not able to sell their `dShares` token leaving them facing more loss
- `dShares` token will depeg if the securities price goes down to be negative.
