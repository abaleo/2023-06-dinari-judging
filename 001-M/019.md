# Escrowed funds are sent to the wrong address when cancelling orders

## Summary
When both buy and sell orders are requested, the payment or asset tokens respectively are transferred from the sender to Dinari. When an order is cancelled one would expect the escrowed tokens to be returned to the original requester, however they are mistakenly sent to the receiver specified in the order request. This could result in a permanent loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
When an order is requested, the relevant tokens (depending on whether the order is a buy or sell order) are transferred from the sender to Dinari as escrow in `_requestOrderAccounting` in both `BuyOrderIssue.sol` and `SellOrderProcessor.sol` (we'll consider the buy case):

```solidity
        // Escrow payment for purchase
        IERC20(orderRequest.paymentToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), orderRequest.quantityIn);
```

When an order is cancelled the escrowed tokens are sent to the recipient defined in the order request in `_cancelOrderAccounting`:

```solidity
        // Return escrow
        IERC20(orderRequest.paymentToken).safeTransfer(orderRequest.recipient, refund);
```

As can be seen in `requestOrder` the recipient of an order request can be any address. The result is that when an order is cancelled the tokens could be returned to a different address from which they were originally transferred from, and thus potentially permanently lost.

## Impact
This could result in a permanent loss of funds for the user in question if the tokens are sent to a smart contract. This smart contract might not contain the logic to withdraw dTokens or to interact with Dinari to request another sell order (if we're considering the sell direction).

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
When both buy and sell orders are cancelled, the escrowed tokens should be returned to the original requester of the order:
