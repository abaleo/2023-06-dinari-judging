# Lack of validation for recipient address in requestOrder()

## Summary

The contract fails to validate the recipient address `orderRequest.recipient` during order fulfillment or creation. As a result, if the address is set to zero (0x0), the funds intended for the recipient will be lost, as the minting operation will proceed without error.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `_fillBuyOrder()` function in `BuyOrderIssuer` the contract fails to validate the recipient address `orderRequest.recipient` during order fulfillment or in previously step order creation. As a result, if the address is set to zero (0x0), the funds intended for the recipient will be lost, as the minting operation will proceed without error.

## Impact

The recipient address in the `orderRequest` parameter is set to zero, the funds that should have been transferred to the recipient will be lost irretrievably. This can lead to financial losses for the affected user.
 
## Code Snippet
 
 `IMintBurn(orderRequest.assetToken).mint(orderRequest.recipient, receivedAmount);`
