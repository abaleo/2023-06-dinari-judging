# Wrong use of `feeState.feesEarned` can lead to loss of funds to the treasury

## Summary

In BuyOrderIssuer.sol, `feeState.feesEarned` is used two ways. Either to store only the Flat Fee or to store Flat Fee + some additional fee. It has contradicting Natspec in the same contract so its use leads to incorrect transfer of tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
The struct states that `feesEarned` is used to calculate **Total Fees Including Flat Fee**

```solidity
struct FeeState {
        // Percentage fees are calculated upfront and accumulated as order is filled
        uint256 remainingPercentageFees;
        // Total fees earned including flat fee
        uint256 feesEarned;
    }
```
In `_requestOrderAccounting`,  `totalFees` is used to calculate the sum of  `flatFee + percentageFee`.
But while initializing `_feeState[orderId]`, `feesEarned: flatFee` is used rather than `totalFees`.

```solidity
 function _requestOrderAccounting(OrderRequest calldata orderRequest, bytes32 orderId)
        internal
        virtual
        override
        returns (Order memory order)
    {
        // Determine fees
        (uint256 flatFee, uint256 percentageFee) = getFeesForOrder(orderRequest.paymentToken, orderRequest.quantityIn);
        uint256 totalFees = flatFee + percentageFee;
        // Fees must not exceed order input value
        if (totalFees >= orderRequest.quantityIn) revert OrderTooSmall();

        // Initialize fee state for order
        _feeState[orderId] = FeeState({remainingPercentageFees: percentageFee, feesEarned: flatFee});

```
But in `_cancelOrderAccounting`, it says `feesEarned is always needed to recover flat fee`. In this function, if the 1st condition is true, then a full refund is carried out. Otherwise the function calls `_closeOrder` with `feeState.feesEarned` which contains only the Flat Fee & not the remaining percentage fee as apposed to the refund being carried out to the user if there are no fills which contains both the remaining & flat fee included.

In the else condition of `_cancelOrderAccounting`, `_closeOrder` call should contain both remainingPercentageFees + feesEarned so that the treasury does not suffer loss.
```solidity
function _cancelOrderAccounting(OrderRequest calldata orderRequest, bytes32 orderId, OrderState memory orderState)
        internal
        virtual
        override
    {
        FeeState memory feeState = _feeState[orderId];
        // If no fills, then full refund
        // This addition is required to check for any fills
        uint256 refund = orderState.remainingOrder + feeState.remainingPercentageFees;
        // If any fills, then orderState.remainingOrder would not be large enough to satisfy this condition
        // feesEarned is always needed to recover flat fee
        if (refund + feeState.feesEarned == orderRequest.quantityIn) {
            _closeOrder(orderId, orderRequest.paymentToken, 0);
            // Refund full payment
            refund = orderRequest.quantityIn;
        } else {
            // Otherwise close order and transfer fees
            _closeOrder(orderId, orderRequest.paymentToken, feeState.feesEarned);
        }

        // Return escrow
        IERC20(orderRequest.paymentToken).safeTransfer(orderRequest.recipient, refund);
    }
```

Also if `feesEarned` is used to calculate flat fee only as shown above, then there shouldn't be any need to update it as shown below in `_fillBuyOrder`.

```solidity
    // Update fee state
            if (collection > 0) {
                _feeState[orderId].remainingPercentageFees = feeState.remainingPercentageFees - collection;
                _feeState[orderId].feesEarned = feeState.feesEarned + collection;
            }
```
## Impact

The treasury can lose funds as the remainingPercentageFee is not added to the feesEarned when are some fills remaining.
The use of `feeState.feesEarned` being two way can be confusing.

## Recommendation
Either use `feeState.feesEarned` to store total fee earned or only the Flat Fee calculated.
