# Griefing attack can block the protocol Buy orders

## Summary

Currently there is only one condition for requesting a new order and that is that the `quantityIn` amount is `>=` to the `totalFees`. This condition is enforced by the protocol during the `orderAccounting` at this line: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dinari/blob/main/sbt-contracts/src/issuer/BuyOrderIssuer.sol#L116. The `totalFees` are calculated within the `getFeesForOrder()` function where the `flatFee` is calculated depending on the `tokenIn` and if the `quantiIn > flatFee` then the `percentageFee` is set, otherwise the `percentageFee` is set to 0.

There are two important notes here:
1/ The protocol team confirmed that the order requests as executed in the order they are submitted, i.e. Order_A, Order_B, Order_C etc.
2/ The initial `flatFee` would be set to `1 ether`, meaning that for example for USDC orders the flat fee would be equal to 1 USDC

## Vulnerability Detail

A malicious actor can stuff the protocol with `invalid` orders, meaning that the `quantityIn` passed for each order would be 1 USDC, i.e. equal to the `flatFee`. This means that the order submission will be valid since `totalFees = 1 + 0 = 1` which is equal to the `quantityIn`. This could lead to user orders being stuck for a prolonged time even if the user wants to `cancelOrder` and get back his funds, his cancellation won't be executed until all previous orders are executed and that depends on how many orders the malicious actor has created. Essentially it would be expected by the Operator to close any invalid orders, so the more viable scenario in this case is for the Operator when stumbling on such orders is to invoke the `closeOrder` functionality which will basically transfer the 1 USDC as fee to the treasury and will clean-up the order.

A more unrealistic scenario is for an Operator instead of cancelling the order, to invoke `fillOrder`. This would cause no interruption in the order execution and would lead to invalid accounting within the protocol, so even tho this scenario requires some sort of mistake on behalf of the Operator, it is worth noticing it. Filling such an order would transfer 1 USDC from the contract to the treasury as fee, 1 USDC from the contract to the Operator as `fillAmount` and will also mint 1 dShare for the user assuming the price of the asset purchased is 1 USD. Since the malicious actor provided only 1 USDC in his `requestOrder` there would be 1 additional USDC which will be taken from the funds of another user who requested an order and is stored within the contract. 

## Impact

Such griefing attack has the following impacts (not considering the more unrealistic scenario of filling the order):
- Block the filling of regular users orders for an undefined time - stuck funds
- Block the cancellation of regular users orders for an undefined time - stuck funds
- Cause the Operator to lose funds for transaction costs - if network is congested and the transaction fees are high it is possible that the cancellation of the order could be more expensive than the 1 USDC of fee accumulated for it, thus leading to loss of funds for the Operators

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The easiest way to avoid such scenario is to set a `minAmountIn` globally for the protocol forcing users that want to `requestOrder` to do so with an amount equal or higher than that threshold.
