# Transactional activities can still go even when ordersPaused variable is set to true

## Summary
In the OrderProcessor contract, there is a modifier called whenOrdersNotPaused which is used to check if orders are paused before executing certain functions. However, this modifier is not applied to all the critical functions in the contract. For example, it is not applied to the function that requests an order (requestOrder) or the functions for filling and canceling orders (fillOrder and cancelOrder).
## Vulnerability Detail
The setOrdersPaused function is used to set the ordersPaused variable, which is meant to pause the execution of certain functions related to the order lifecycle when it is set to true. However, upon closer inspection, it can be seen that the whenOrdersNotPaused modifier, which is supposed to prevent the execution of functions when orders are paused, is not applied to any critical functions.
This means that even when the ordersPaused variable is set to true, users can still request orders, operators can still fill orders, and users can still request order cancellations. 
## Impact
If an attacker calls a critical function while the contract is in a paused state, they can still transfer funds, leading to a loss of funds for the user

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation 
The whenOrdersNotPaused modifier should be applied to the relevant functions involved in the order lifecycle to ensure that they can only be executed when orders are not paused. By adding this modifier to functions such as requestOrder, fillOrder, and cancelOrder, the code can prevent the execution of these critical functions when orders are paused, thereby providing the intended pause functionality.
