# OrderProcessor.fillOrder() does not have any constraints for receivedAmount

## Summary
The fillOrder() function in the OrderProcessor contract lacks a check to guarantee that the user's receivedAmount matches the expected price. This can result in users losing funds if the market is volatile.

## Vulnerability Detail
The code snippet provided shows the implementation of the fillOrder() function. However, there is no check to compare the receivedAmount against the expected price to protect the user's funds when the market is volatile.

```solidity
function fillOrder(OrderRequest calldata orderRequest, bytes32 salt, uint256 fillAmount, uint256 receivedAmount)
        external
        nonReentrant
        onlyRole(OPERATOR_ROLE)
    {
        // No nonsense
        if (fillAmount == 0) revert ZeroValue();
        bytes32 orderId = getOrderIdFromOrderRequest(orderRequest, salt);
        OrderState memory orderState = _orders[orderId];
        // Order must exist
        if (orderState.requester == address(0)) revert OrderNotFound();
        // Fill cannot exceed remaining order
        if (fillAmount > orderState.remainingOrder) revert AmountTooLarge();


        // Notify order filled
        emit OrderFill(orderId, orderRequest.recipient, fillAmount, receivedAmount);


        // Update order state
        uint256 remainingOrder = orderState.remainingOrder - fillAmount;
        // If order is completely filled then clear order state
        if (remainingOrder == 0) {
            // Notify order fulfilled
            emit OrderFulfilled(orderId, orderRequest.recipient);
            // Clear order state
            delete _orders[orderId];
            _numOpenOrders--;
        } else {
            // Otherwise update order state
            _orders[orderId].remainingOrder = remainingOrder;
            _orders[orderId].received = orderState.received + receivedAmount;
        }


        // Move tokens
        _fillOrderAccounting(orderRequest, orderId, orderState, fillAmount, receivedAmount);
    }
```
        

## Impact

When a user creates a Market Order, they expect to receive a return amount based on the current market price within an acceptable range. Without a check of the receivedAmount against the expected price, users can experience losses if the actual received amount deviates significantly from their expectations.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this issue, it is recommended to include a check to compare the receivedAmount against the expected price. This can be done by multiplying the fillAmount with the price and then determines the minimum and maximum expected amounts based on the orderRange. If the received amount falls outside this range, the function reverts with an UnexpectedReceivedAmount error.
