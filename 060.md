# Lack of slippage protection when executing the order

## Summary
While the general nature of market orders means that the order is filled at whatever is the current market rate, the current implementation of filling an order does not offer any protection against:

- Slippage

It is more than likely that a user will receive much less dShare than expected due to either:

- The off-chain process took too long and the real-world stock price has moved rapidly and the order never expires

There are no protections in place to prevent against receiving a low quantity of dShare. In today's world of DeFi, most users will not simply trust that they will receive a fair amount of value after all processes have been completed.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `_fillBuyOrder()` function of `BuyOrderIssuer.sol` does not contain any checks that the `receivedAmount` is within an acceptable range.

```solidity
    function _fillBuyOrder(
        OrderRequest calldata orderRequest,
        bytes32 orderId,
        OrderState memory orderState,
        uint256 fillAmount,
        uint256 receivedAmount
    ) internal virtual {
        FeeState memory feeState = _feeState[orderId];
        uint256 remainingOrder = orderState.remainingOrder - fillAmount;
        // If order is done, close order and transfer fees
        if (remainingOrder == 0) {
            _closeOrder(orderId, orderRequest.paymentToken, feeState.remainingPercentageFees + feeState.feesEarned);
        } else {
            // Otherwise accumulate fees for fill
            // Calculate fees
            uint256 collection = 0;
            if (feeState.remainingPercentageFees > 0) {
                // fee = remainingPercentageFees * fillAmount / remainingOrder
                collection = PrbMath.mulDiv(feeState.remainingPercentageFees, fillAmount, orderState.remainingOrder);
            }
            // Update fee state
            if (collection > 0) {
                _feeState[orderId].remainingPercentageFees = feeState.remainingPercentageFees - collection;
                _feeState[orderId].feesEarned = feeState.feesEarned + collection;
            }
        }


        // Mint asset
        IMintBurn(orderRequest.assetToken).mint(orderRequest.recipient, receivedAmount);
    }
```

## Impact
- Received amount of dShares must be trusted by Dinari users. This value will often be less than expected, leading to less interest in the protocol.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Even for market orders, it would be worth creating a share price oracle that would stamp the current exchange rate at time of order request. Then the `_fillBuyOrder()` function would verify that the `receivedAmount` is within perhaps 10% of the expected amount.

also, the protocol can let user speicify a minReceived amount to avoid slippage
