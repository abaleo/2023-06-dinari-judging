# Recipient address in OrderRequest is never validated

## Summary
Recipient address in OrderRequest is never validated and can open uncanceled orders forever.

## Vulnerability Detail
If the recipient address is not validated, it can cause problems with filling or canceling the order. When the recipient address is equal to address(0) or is a blacklisted address, transferring payment tokens becomes impossible because stablecoins like USDC/USDT do not allow such transfers.

## Impact
Orders can be requested but never will be fully filled or closed. Additionally, the money in the contract will become stuck.

## Code Snippet
[BuyOrderIssuer-214](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dinari/blob/main/sbt-contracts/src/issuer/BuyOrderIssuer.sol#L214)

```solidity
// Return escrow
IERC20(orderRequest.paymentToken).safeTransfer(orderRequest.recipient, refund);
```

[SellOrderProcessor-171](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dinari/blob/main/sbt-contracts/src/issuer/SellOrderProcessor.sol#L171)

```solidity
 // Transfer proceeds to recipient
if (proceeds > 0) {
     IERC20(paymentToken).safeTransfer(recipient, proceeds);
}
```
