# Lack of slippage check and deadline can cause user to pay undesired amounts when buying or selling a market order

## Summary

Lack of slippage check and deadline can cause user to pay undesired amounts when buying or selling a market order

## Vulnerability Detail

When creating an order, a user calls `requestOrder` and sets his order.  The operator will do the computation off chain and give them the `receivedAmount` back. 

```solidity
    /// @dev Emits OrderRequested event to be sent to fulfillment service (operator)
    function requestOrder(OrderRequest calldata orderRequest, bytes32 salt) public nonReentrant whenOrdersNotPaused {
        // Reject spam orders
        if (orderRequest.quantityIn == 0) revert ZeroValue();
        // Check for whitelisted tokens
        _checkRole(ASSETTOKEN_ROLE, orderRequest.assetToken);
        _checkRole(PAYMENTTOKEN_ROLE, orderRequest.paymentToken);
        bytes32 orderId = getOrderIdFromOrderRequest(orderRequest, salt);
        // Order must not already exist
        if (_orders[orderId].remainingOrder > 0) revert DuplicateOrder();


        // Get order from request and move tokens
        Order memory order = _requestOrderAccounting(orderRequest, orderId);
```

```solidity
    function fillOrder(OrderRequest calldata orderRequest, bytes32 salt, uint256 fillAmount, uint256 receivedAmount)
```

However, since its a market order, the user can get a match order that is too far off from the desired price. For example, if a user wants to buy 1 dinari apple share and last price is trading at 1000, the user should be able to have a slippage parameter that states that he is willing to pay between x% deviation from 1000, in case someone else sells a really expensive apple share.

Also, there can be long periods of time where the order can be stagnant, in which it would be more efficient for the user to have a expiration date than to call for a `requestCancel`.

## Impact

User may get an undesirable amount back and have to rely solely on the operator to give a fair and accurate price.

## Recommendation

Recommend having a deviation threshold and deadline parameter to further protect the user order.
