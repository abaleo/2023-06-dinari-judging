# If a sell order for dShares is executed in partial steps, users may incur additional fees.

## Summary
If a sell order for dShares is filled/executed in partial steps, users may incur additional fees.

## Vulnerability Detail
Large buy/sell orders will be mostly executed in partial steps by the Operator (as per the protocol's design).

Whenever a full or partial sell order is executed the protocol accumulates a fee from the user. In `SellOrderProcessor._distributeProceeds()` that fee is transferred to the treasury and payments are sent to the user. In `_distributeProceeds()`,  there is a condition where if the payment received is equal to or smaller than the fees, the protocol accumulates the fees, burns users' Assets and the user receives nothing.
```solidity
    function _distributeProceeds(address paymentToken, address recipient, uint256 totalReceived, uint256 feesEarned)
        private
    {
        // Check if accumulated fees are larger than total received
        uint256 proceeds = 0;
        uint256 collection = 0;
        if (totalReceived > feesEarned) {
            // Take fees from total received before distributing
            proceeds = totalReceived - feesEarned;
            collection = feesEarned;
        } else {
            ///@audit this can result in loss for users
            // If accumulated fees are larger than total received, then no proceeds go to recipient
            collection = totalReceived;
        }
        // Transfer proceeds to recipient
        if (proceeds > 0) {
            IERC20(paymentToken).safeTransfer(recipient, proceeds);
        }
        // Transfer fees to treasury
        if (collection > 0) {
            IERC20(paymentToken).safeTransfer(treasury, collection);
        }
    }
```

Now this is okay for small orders because they will be executed/filled in one time but it can be a problem for large orders, which will be executed in partial steps.

For instance, if Bob places a large sell order for dShares and the Operator executes it in multiple steps, the first steps may pay Bob almost all the tokens, leaving only a small portion behind. If the remaining tokens are equal to or less than the fees, the last partial order will result in Bob paying extra payment tokens and having their asset tokens burned for no gain.

## Impact
- Loss of funds for users, Payment Tokens + Asset Tokens.

## Recommendation
To address this issue and prevent losses for users, it is recommended to revise the logic in the _distributeProceeds() function. Rather than penalizing users with fees, consider returning the dShares to them without any additional charges. Alternatively, implement a mechanism to temporarily freeze the tokens for a specific period of time. These measures would ensure fair treatment for users and mitigate the risk of financial losses.
