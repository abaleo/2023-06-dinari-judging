# Blacklisted accounts can own dShares which violates OFAC sanctions

## Summary
OFAC has sanctions in place to prevent foreign regimes, terrorists and others from holding US securities. Dinari has protections in place to prevent blacklisted accounts (that are known to be associated with entities on the OFAC sanctions list) from transferring dTokens. However Dinari mistakenly excludes minting from transfer restriction checking which allows a blacklisted user to purchase and own dTokens and thus the underlying security.

## Vulnerability Detail
This issue exists because Dinari explicitly excludes minting from transfer restriction checking:

```solidity
    function _beforeTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256) internal virtual override {
        // Restrictions ignored for minting and burning
        // If transferRestrictor is not set, no restrictions are applied
        if (from == address(0) || to == address(0) || address(transferRestrictor) == address(0)) {
            return;
        }

        // Check transfer restrictions
        transferRestrictor.requireNotRestricted(from, to);
    }
```

Even though the blacklisted account will not be able to sell or transfer the dToken, they will still be able to receive dividend payments associated with their holdings.

The faulty behaviour can be demonstrated with a super simple test case that can be executed with `forge test -vvv --match-path test/BridgedERC20.t.sol`:

```

## Impact
Dinari is failing to properly enforce any OFAC sanctions by allowing blacklisted users to receive dTokens. This could result in regulatory action and fines against Dinari.

## Recommendation
Restrictions should not be ignored for minting:
