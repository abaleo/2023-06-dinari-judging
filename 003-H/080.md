# Users can circumvent blacklist to continue to receive and send tokens

## Summary

Malicious users can circumvent the blacklist by using standard functionality of the BuyOrderIssuer contract to send and receive tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the natspec of the `restrict` function of the TransferRestrictor contract, the intention of the blacklist is described as being for preventing an account  from 'sending or receiving' tokens. However, a user who is blacklisted can still do so because the blacklist does not apply to minting tokens. Specifically, the `_beforeTokenTransfer` hook of the BridgedERC20 contract is intended to prevent actions by blacklisted addresses, and is defined as follows:
```solidity
function _beforeTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256) internal virtual override {
    // Restrictions ignored for minting and burning
    // If transferRestrictor is not set, no restrictions are applied
    if (from == address(0) || to == address(0) || address(transferRestrictor) == address(0)) {
        return;
    }

    // Check transfer restrictions
    transferRestrictor.requireNotRestricted(from, to);
}
```
The issue with this implementation is that it is arbitrary for a restricted address to circumvent these checks by using the BuyOrderIssuer functions. This is because the `_fillBuyOrder` function of the BuyOrderIssuer directly mints the tokens to an arbitrary address of the user's choosing. This means they can send tokens to a blacklisted address, or as a blacklisted address be able to send tokens to any other arbitrary address. This breaks the desired functionality of the blacklist, as blacklisted users should not be able to perform these actions.

## Impact

Malicious users can circumvent the blacklist by using standard functionality of the BuyOrderIssuer contract to send and receive tokens, breaking the blacklist functionality.

## Recommendation

The `_beforeTokenTransfer` function of the BridgedERC20 contract should be updated to prevent minting from and to restricted addresses.
