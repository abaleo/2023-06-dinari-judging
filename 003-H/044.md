# OrderProcessor.sol# - incorrect usage of the BridgedERC20

## Summary
Request creation and filling involves moving round of token assets, mainly for payment tokens, minting, burning, etc. With the currently written version of the contract, it doesn't utilize the features the protocol creates, which could lead to inconveniences both for the users, operators and thus - fund loss.

## Vulnerability Detail
The current definition of the BridgeERC20's mint and burn functions do not take into account for the blacklist, as intended by the protocol, which is a bad behavior. With the current way some orders are filled, dShares get minted directly to the caller who can in fact be a blacklisted user.
## Impact
Blacklisted users can still execute certain request uninterrupted, contrary to protocol intentions, creating more manual work for the operators.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Either a fail-safe on the mint/burn functions for blacklisted users or by using IBridgedERC20 instead of IERC20 on token transfers to correctly make use of the blacklist check implemented in ``_beforeTokenTransfer``.
