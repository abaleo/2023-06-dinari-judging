# There is no unique way to define the salt value. This will potentially miss the orders.

## Summary

The contact uses the `salt` and [orderRequest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dinari/blob/main/sbt-contracts/src/issuer/OrderProcessor.sol#L47) to determine the unique order id which is used as key for order map.
But there are no clarity on how the salt would be generated behind the scene and there are no implementation at contract level.
Implementation is done such that user would raise request with salt value and operator uses the salt value to execute the order request. But there are no guarantee that both salt are same.

## Vulnerability Detail

when we look at the [requestOrder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dinari/blob/main/sbt-contracts/src/issuer/OrderProcessor.sol#L244), [cancelOrder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dinari/blob/main/sbt-contracts/src/issuer/OrderProcessor.sol#L330) both are called by the user with order request detail and salt value. later this order request and salt would be used to generate unique id by calling the [getOrderIdFromOrderRequest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dinari/blob/main/sbt-contracts/src/issuer/OrderProcessor.sol#L335) function.

when we look at the [fillOrder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dinari/blob/main/sbt-contracts/src/issuer/OrderProcessor.sol#L272C14-L272C23), one of the input argument is salt. But, it is possible that the salt that is used while raising request and this one could be different.

## Impact

it is not clear how the salt is going to be handled. If there is plan to store the salt value off chain and use it to process, then any loss of data would render the system unusable.

If some of the salt is missed, the order which are placed can not be retrieved. only way is to try with trial and error approach which is practically not possible.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

we suggest to implement a mechanism to track the salt value for each order which is requested.
