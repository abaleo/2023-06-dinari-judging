# Submission of duplicate orders with the same order ID is allowed

## Summary
The requestOrder function allows users to request an order by providing an orderRequest object and a salt. The function calculates the order ID based on the orderRequest and the salt using the getOrderIdFromOrderRequest function.
The issue with this code is that it doesn't check for duplicate order IDs before creating a new order. As a result, if an order with the same order ID is submitted multiple times, it would create multiple orders with the same ID, leading to unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds.
## Vulnerability Detail
The attacker generates an order with a specific order ID.
The attacker submits the order to the contract.
Before the transaction is confirmed, the attacker generates another order with the same order ID. 
The attacker submits the second order to the contract.
Since the contract does not check for duplicate order IDs, both orders will be accepted, resulting in multiple active orders with the same order ID. This can cause confusion and inconsistencies in the order processing logic, leading to unexpected outcomes and potential financial losses.
## Impact
An attacker can intentionally submit duplicate orders with the same order ID to manipulate the order processing logic. This can lead to financial loss for users or the contract itself, such as draining funds, double-spending, or disrupting the intended flow of operations.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement checks that prevent the submission of duplicate orders. One possible solution is to maintain a mapping of order IDs that have already been used. Before processing a new order, the contract should check if the order ID already exists in the mapping. If it does, the contract should reject the order and revert the transaction.
