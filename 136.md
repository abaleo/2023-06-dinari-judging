# If the user is added to the USDC/USDT blacklist, then the refund process does not work.

## Summary
If the user is added to the USDC/USDT blacklist, then the refund process does not work.

## Vulnerability Detail
When _cancelOrderAccounting() is called in the BuyOrderIssuer contract, will transfer paymentToken for example USDC to recipient address but issue is when user request order and this must be cancel for any reason like order is not acceptable from operator or user want to cancel whatever... and user blacklisted in USDC for example, refund cant be occur.

## Impact
Users who are blacklisted after requesting an order cant get tokens in the refund process.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function _cancelOrderAccounting(OrderRequest calldata orderRequest, bytes32 orderId, OrderState memory orderState)
        internal
        virtual
        override
    {
        FeeState memory feeState = _feeState[orderId];
        // If no fills, then full refund
        // This addition is required to check for any fills
        uint256 refund = orderState.remainingOrder + feeState.remainingPercentageFees;
        // If any fills, then orderState.remainingOrder would not be large enough to satisfy this condition
        // feesEarned is always needed to recover flat fee
        if (refund + feeState.feesEarned == orderRequest.quantityIn) {
            _closeOrder(orderId, orderRequest.paymentToken, 0);
            // Refund full payment
            refund = orderRequest.quantityIn;
        } else {
            // Otherwise close order and transfer fees
            _closeOrder(orderId, orderRequest.paymentToken, feeState.feesEarned);
        }


        // Return escrow
        IERC20(orderRequest.paymentToken).safeTransfer(orderRequest.recipient, refund);
    }
```

## Recommendation
Consider the refund() function that the user should call and transfer tokens to the address that wanted.
