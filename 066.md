# Front-Running Vulnerability in TransferRestrictor Contract's restrict Function

## Summary

 Potential Front-Running Vulnerability in the `restrict` Function of the `TransferRestrictor` Contract.


## Vulnerability Detail

The `restrict` function in the `TransferRestrictor` contract is susceptible to front-running attacks. This function allows the contract owner to add an account to a blacklist, which restricts the account from sending or receiving tokens. The issue lies in the fact that once a transaction is broadcast to restrict an account, it is visible in the mempool where malicious actors can observe it before it's mined.

A user might be incentivized to front-run the `restrict`  transaction with a transaction that mitigates the consequences of being blacklisted (e.g., moving their tokens to another address) by providing a higher gas fee, which would increase the likelihood of their transaction being mined before the restrict transaction.


## Impact

A user could potentially avoid being blacklisted and continue to send or receive tokens even after a restriction has been attempted. This could lead to potential misuse or manipulation of the platform, and might result in undermining the control the owner has over token transfers.


## Code Snippet

The vulnerability lies in the restrict function in the TransferRestrictor contract:

[Link to code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dinari/blob/main/sbt-contracts/src/TransferRestrictor.sol#L37-L40)

```solidity

function restrict(address account) external onlyOwner {
    blacklist[account] = true;
    emit Restricted(account);
}


```


## Tool used



Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate front-running risks, consider employing a commit-reveal scheme or submit the restrict transaction as a private transaction via services such as Flashbots or similar relays. The latter bypasses the public mempool, preventing front-running by directly communicating with miners. As always, any new implementation should be thoroughly tested and audited.
