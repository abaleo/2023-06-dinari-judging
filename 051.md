# No Storage Gap in OrderProcessor and BuyOrderIssuer contracts Might Lead to Storage Slot Collision

## Summary

When upgrading contracts, adding new storage variables to inherited contracts can potentially overwrite the initial storage layout of the child contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

Without storage gap in the `OrderProcessor` and `BuyOrderIssuer` contracts, the variable in child contract might be overwritten by the upgraded base contract if new variables are added to the base contract.

## Impact

Upgrading the storage variable in the base contract can overwrite the variable declared in its child contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add the recommended storage gap to the `OrderProcessor` and `BuyOrderIssuer` contracts as suggested in the [OpenZeppelin Upgradeable](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/writing-upgradeable#storage-gaps) contract templates.
