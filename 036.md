# Frontrunning possibility in requestOrder() function leading to transaction reversion.

## Summary

The function getOrderIdFromOrderRequest() in the code is responsible for calculating the orderId during the request order process. However, there is a vulnerability where a frontrunning bot can call the same function with the same data and obtain the same orderId. This results in a revert for a normal user whose call comes after the bot.

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability lies in the getOrderIdFromOrderRequest() function, which retrieves the order ID deterministically based on the order request and salt. The code snippet for this function can be found here:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dinari/blob/main/sbt-contracts/src/issuer/OrderProcessor.sol#L205-L216

The order request and salt are input parameters to the requestOrder function, which means a frontrunning bot can see these values and call the same function with the same data to obtain a predetermined orderId:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dinari/blob/main/sbt-contracts/src/issuer/OrderProcessor.sol#L250

The check for duplicate orders occurs within the following if statement:

        if (_orders[orderId].remainingOrder > 0) revert DuplicateOrder();


Once a frontrunning bot executes the function first, subsequent calls from regular users will be reverted.

While I understand that an attacker will be compelled to transfer funds during the order request, which they can later cancel to reclaim their funds, I want to draw attention to the issue of the deterministic nature of obtaining the orderId. It depends on input data that can be manipulated. In my recommendation, I propose a possible solution to this problem.

## Impact

This vulnerability blocks users from successfully placing their orders.

## Recommendation

To mitigate frontrunning attacks in the requestOrder function, I recommend adding the msg.sender parameter to the getOrderIdFromOrderRequest function while calculating keccak256. This modification will ensure that each order has a unique orderId, even if the data and salt are the same.

Looking at the rest of the code, it appears that the getOrderIdFromOrderRequest function is used in other functions where the msg.sender parameter cannot be utilized. However, in these cases, callers can submit the orderId without the need to use the getOrderIdFromOrderRequest function every time.
