# Escrow could be taken from a cancelled order leaving other users unable to cancel

## Summary
If a `cancelOrder` transaction is included on chain before a `takeEscrow` transaction for the same order id, then the `takeEscrow` call still succeeds and the Dinari issuer contract will have less than expected payment token balance, leading to other users having their cancel orders fail due to insufficient token balance.

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's say a user places a request for a buy order through the `DirectBuyIssuer.sol` contract. Before the order can be filled the escrowed funds must be taken by the operator by calling `takeEscrow`. Now, if there is network congestion or the current gas price exceeds the price paid by the operator for the `takeEscrow` call, it is possible that this transaction can sit in the mempool for a while.

Now, let's imagine the user has changed their mind and have decided to cancel their buy order. They call `requestCancel`, after which the operator will then call `cancelOrder`. It is possible that both of these transactions are included on chain before the `takeEscrow` transaction. All of the transactions will succeed.

However the operator (as a trusted user and assuming they notice) will now try to call `returnEscrow` to return the escrow. This transaction will fail because the underlying order has been cancelled.

Below is a test case that demonstrates this behaviour. I can be executed with `forge test -vvv --match-path test/DirectBuyIssuer.t.sol`:

+        vm.prank(operator);
+        issuer.returnEscrow(order, salt, 5 ether);
+    }
 }

```

## Impact
In the worst case scenario Dinari do not have a mechanism in place to detect this failure and the end result is that the last user who wants to cancel their order won't be able to do so since there is too little of the payment token in the issuer contract.

The best case scenario is that Dinari have a mechanism to detect this failure and have to make a manual transfer of the payment token to "top up" the issuer contract to the correct value.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The escrow for an order should be set to 0 when the order is cancelled:
