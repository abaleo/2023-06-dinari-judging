## Summary
The ```BuyOrderIssuer#_fillBuyOrder()``` function mints 1-to-1 based on the number of stablecoin received.
## Vulnerability Detail
In description of the order processing functionality, the whitepaper mentions that when submitting an order: 

> "users specify an asset token (the dShare) and a payment token (e.g. USDC). A buy order takes payment token and gives dShares when filled. A sell order takes dShares and gives payment token when filled. dShares are minted or burned by the order processor as the order is filled". 

Inside the ```BuyOrderIssuer#_fillBuyOrder```, the number of dShares is minted based on the passed ```receivedAmount``` parameter, which is the amount of received token (USDC or USDT). For instance, if I create a buy order with 10 USDC I will receive 10 dShares.
```solidity
    function _fillBuyOrder(
        OrderRequest calldata orderRequest,
        bytes32 orderId,
        OrderState memory orderState,
        uint256 fillAmount,
        uint256 receivedAmount
    ) internal virtual {
        FeeState memory feeState = _feeState[orderId];
        uint256 remainingOrder = orderState.remainingOrder - fillAmount;

        if (remainingOrder == 0) {
            _closeOrder(orderId, orderRequest.paymentToken, feeState.remainingPercentageFees + feeState.feesEarned);
        } else {
           //..
        }

        // Mint asset
        //@audit if usdt or usdc depegs then this will cause issues
        //an oracle should be used here
        IMintBurn(orderRequest.assetToken).mint(orderRequest.recipient, receivedAmount);
    }
```
Likewise, with the 10 dShares I can create a sell order and receive 10 USDT in exchange. This is essentially a pegged one-to-one exchange between the USDT and USDC. If either de-pegs from their dollar price, the tre
