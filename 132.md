# Wrong implementation of EIP-712

## Summary
Wrong implementation of EIP-712

## Vulnerability Detail
`ORDERREQUEST_TYPE_HASH` used for hashing of order id has typos. It is missed closed bracket `)`.

## Impact
Incorrect hashing of order IDs can result in a discrepancy between off-chain and on-chain hashing.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dinari/blob/main/sbt-contracts/src/issuer/OrderProcessor.sol#L96

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make the following changes:

```solidity diff
-  keccak256("OrderRequest(bytes32 salt,address recipient,address assetToken,address paymentToken,uint256 quantityIn");

+  keccak256("OrderRequest(bytes32 salt,address recipient,address assetToken,address paymentToken,uint256 quantityIn)");
