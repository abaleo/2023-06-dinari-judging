# [M-01] Centralisation Risk For Trusted Owners

## Summary
Contract ```BridgedERC20.sol``` contains many functions that can be only executed by the contract owner, specifically, who possesses the ```DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE```
## Vulnerability Detail
```DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE```  has the authority to make changes to critical aspects of the contract, such as its name, symbol, and transfer restrictions. If the owner were to act maliciously or perform unauthorized updates, it could potentially compromise the integrity and security of the contract. Moreover, the owner's control over the minting and burning functions could be misused to manipulate token supply or drain funds from the contract.
## Vulnerability Severity
Medium
## Impact
Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
File: BridgedERC20.sol

81:     function setName(string calldata name_) external onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {

88:     function setSymbol(string calldata symbol_) external onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {

95:     function setDisclosures(string calldata disclosures_) external onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {

102:     function setTransferRestrictor(ITransferRestrictor restrictor) external onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {

113:     function mint(address to, uint256 value) external virtual onlyRole(MINTER_ROLE) {

120:     function burn(uint256 value) external virtual onlyRole(BURNER_ROLE) {

## Recommendation
Consider the privileges and responsibilities assigned to contract owners. Limiting the scope of their authority, implementing multi-signature mechanisms, or introducing additional checks and balances can help reduce the centralization risk associated with trusted owners.
