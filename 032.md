# [GAS OPTIMIZATION] Use orderId directly vs. computing the ID with salt on order creation/cancel/fill and escrow

## Summary
Currently, the way the contract is setup, to create, cancel and fill an order and to take and return escrow, it is expected to send the order and the salt which is then computed on chain at every call to retrieve the ID. Since all this data is public and should be available off chain, it would reduce gas costs of all these calls if the user was to simply send the `orderId` directly. 

It would require a bit more work front-end or back-end side, but it is very minimal as the contracts allow to actually compute that via the `getOrderIdFromOrderRequest` method.

The event `OrderRequested` would also cost lower as it would not include the salt. 

It would also keep the salt off chain since it doesn't need to be sent.

## Vulnerability Detail
Not a vulnerability but a gas optimization.

## Impact
You would have to change the following methods:
* `requestOrder` (OrderProcessor.sol line 244)
* `fillOrder` (OrderProcessor.sol line 272)
* `requestCancel` (OrderProcessor.sol line 313)
* `cancelOrder` (OrderProcessor.sol line 330)
* `OrderRequested` (IOrderBridge.sol line 56), the event
* `takeEscrow` (DirectBuyIssuer.sol line 53)
* `returnEscrow` (DirectBuyIssuer.sol line 78)

## Code Snippet

To give an example, here's how the `requestOrder` would be optimized:
```solidity
    /// @notice Request an order
    /// @param orderRequest Order request to submit
    /// @param orderId order ID
    /// @dev Emits OrderRequested event to be sent to fulfillment service (operator)
    function requestOrder(OrderRequest calldata orderRequest, bytes32 orderId) public nonReentrant whenOrdersNotPaused {
        // Reject spam orders
        if (orderRequest.quantityIn == 0) revert ZeroValue();
        // Check for whitelisted tokens
        _checkRole(ASSETTOKEN_ROLE, orderRequest.assetToken);
        _checkRole(PAYMENTTOKEN_ROLE, orderRequest.paymentToken);
        // Order must not already exist
        if (_orders[orderId].remainingOrder > 0) revert DuplicateOrder();

        // Get order from request and move tokens
        Order memory order = _requestOrderAccounting(orderRequest, orderId);

        // Send order to bridge
        emit OrderRequested(orderId, order.recipient, order);

        // Initialize order state
        uint256 orderAmount = order.sell ? order.assetTokenQuantity : order.paymentTokenQuantity;
        _orders[orderId] = OrderState({requester: msg.sender, remainingOrder: orderAmount, received: 0});
        _numOpenOrders++;
    }
```

The other methods would require similar changes.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Sending the salt to the contract and computing it on chain offers no extra security and actually requires more work on chain. This work can be done off chain as it those values (the salt) are available.
