# Blocklisted recipient or address(0) force operator to waste gas when filling the sell order or filling the cancel order

## Summary

Blocklisted recipient or address(0) force operator to waste gas when filling the order

## Vulnerability Detail

When creating the order, the asset token and payment token is whitelited and validated

```solidity
   function requestOrder(OrderRequest calldata orderRequest, bytes32 salt) public nonReentrant whenOrdersNotPaused {
        // Reject spam orders
        if (orderRequest.quantityIn == 0) revert ZeroValue();
        // Check for whitelisted tokens
        _checkRole(ASSETTOKEN_ROLE, orderRequest.assetToken);
        _checkRole(PAYMENTTOKEN_ROLE, orderRequest.paymentToken);
        bytes32 orderId = getOrderIdFromOrderRequest(orderRequest, salt);
        // Order must not already exist
        if (_orders[orderId].remainingOrder > 0) revert DuplicateOrder();

        // Get order from request and move tokens
        Order memory order = _requestOrderAccounting(orderRequest, orderId);

        // Send order to bridge
        emit OrderRequested(orderId, order.recipient, order, salt);

        // Initialize order state
        uint256 orderAmount = order.sell ? order.assetTokenQuantity : order.paymentTokenQuantity;
        _orders[orderId] = OrderState({requester: msg.sender, remainingOrder: orderAmount, received: 0});
        _numOpenOrders++;
    }

```

but the order.recipient is never validated

the payment token can be USDC and support blocklist, the user can set order.recipient to a blocked token address

the user can also set the recipient address to address(0)

then later when the operator want to fill in the order

the operator are force to waste gas and the order filling transaction keep reverting because the recipient cannot receive the payment token in Sell Order

```solidity
    function _distributeProceeds(address paymentToken, address recipient, uint256 totalReceived, uint256 feesEarned)
        private
    {
        // Check if accumulated fees are larger than total received
        uint256 proceeds = 0;
        uint256 collection = 0;
        if (totalReceived > feesEarned) {
            // Take fees from total received before distributing
            proceeds = totalReceived - feesEarned;
            collection = feesEarned;
        } else {
            // If accumulated fees are larger than total received, then no proceeds go to recipient
            collection = totalReceived;
        }

        // Transfer proceeds to recipient
        if (proceeds > 0) {
            IERC20(paymentToken).safeTransfer(recipient, proceeds);
        }
        // Transfer fees to treasury
        if (collection > 0) {
            IERC20(paymentToken).safeTransfer(treasury, collection);
        }
    }
```

In BuyOrder

User can send a tiny amount of payment and then call cancel order

the operator is expected to help user cancel order, but when he doing so, the gas is wasted because the transaction would keep reverting because the recipient address is blocklisted or address(0)

## Impact

Blocklisted recipient or address(0) force operator to waste gas when filling the sell order or filling the cancel order

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the protocol validate the recipient address to not let user set a blocklisted address or address(0)
