# Corruptible Upgradeable Pattern

## Summary
Storage of OrderProcessor might be corrupted due to upgrade.

## Vulnerability Detail

OrderProcessor is meant to be upgradeable, however, no storage gap has been implemented in `OrderProcessor.sol` and the inherited contract, `SelfPermit.sol`.

## Impact

Storage of `OrderProcessor` might be corrupted during upgrading, thus breaking core functionalities and causing unexpected behavior.
>>> For upgradeable contracts, there must be storage gap to "allow developers to freely add new state variables in the future without compromising the storage compatibility with existing deployments". Otherwise it may be very difficult to write new implementation code. Without storage gap, the variable in child contract might be overwritten by the upgraded base contract if new variables are added to the base contract. This could have unintended and very serious consequences to the child contracts.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Recommend adding appropriate storage gap at the end of upgradeable contracts such as the below. Please reference OpenZeppelin upgradeable contract templates.

```solidity
uint256[50] private __gap; // gap to reserve storage in the contract for future variable additions
```
