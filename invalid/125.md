# Lack of clarity to classify the order that are requested for order and that are requested for cancel.

## Summary

when we look at the order handling mechanism, for both requesting the order and requesting for cancel, single struct [OrderRequest ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dinari/blob/main/sbt-contracts/src/issuer/OrderProcessor.sol#L47-L58) is used. At the end of each request, relevant event is emitted. I think, the idea behind this event emitting is to capture this by the operator and execute the relevant functionality in the Order Process contract.

But, when we look at the flow, there are no firm control over the order request which are for placing or cancelling at the block chain level.
This will make the system clumsy when there are large number of orders are requested. behind the scene, if there is issue with event handling, then the order which are requested for placing could get cancelled and vice versa can happen for cancel request.

Note: events are not stored in the blockchain.  

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
    function requestOrder(OrderRequest calldata orderRequest, bytes32 salt) public nonReentrant whenOrdersNotPaused {
        // Reject spam orders
        if (orderRequest.quantityIn == 0) revert ZeroValue();
        // Check for whitelisted tokens
        _checkRole(ASSETTOKEN_ROLE, orderRequest.assetToken);
        _checkRole(PAYMENTTOKEN_ROLE, orderRequest.paymentToken);
        bytes32 orderId = getOrderIdFromOrderRequest(orderRequest, salt);
        // Order must not already exist
        if (_orders[orderId].remainingOrder > 0) revert DuplicateOrder();


        // Get order from request and move tokens
        Order memory order = _requestOrderAccounting(orderRequest, orderId);


        // Send order to bridge
        emit OrderRequested(orderId, order.recipient, order, salt);

```

```solidity
    function requestCancel(OrderRequest calldata orderRequest, bytes32 salt) external {
        bytes32 orderId = getOrderIdFromOrderRequest(orderRequest, salt);
        address requester = _orders[orderId].requester;
        // Order must exist
        if (requester == address(0)) revert OrderNotFound();
        // Only requester can request cancellation
        if (requester != msg.sender) revert NotRequester();


        // Send cancel request to bridge
        emit CancelRequested(orderId, orderRequest.recipient);
    }
```

In above both functions, events `OrderRequested`, `CancelRequested` are emitted. But they are not stored either in the order or in the orderstate struct.

when we look at the fill-order and cancel order functions, `OrderRequest`  data is given as input with relevant bytes, after that the `OrderState` data is used to do basic validation such as `requester`, `remainingOrder`

```solidity
    function fillOrder(OrderRequest calldata orderRequest, bytes32 salt, uint256 fillAmount, uint256 receivedAmount)
        external
        nonReentrant
        onlyRole(OPERATOR_ROLE)
    {
        // No nonsense
        if (fillAmount == 0) revert ZeroValue();
        bytes32 orderId = getOrderIdFromOrderRequest(orderRequest, salt);
        OrderState memory orderState = _orders[orderId];
        // Order must exist
        if (orderState.requester == address(0)) revert OrderNotFound();
        // Fill cannot exceed remaining order
        if (fillAmount > orderState.remainingOrder) revert AmountTooLarge();
```

```solidity
    function cancelOrder(OrderRequest calldata orderRequest, bytes32 salt, string calldata reason)
        external
        nonReentrant
        onlyRole(OPERATOR_ROLE)
    {
        bytes32 orderId = getOrderIdFromOrderRequest(orderRequest, salt);
        OrderState memory orderState = _orders[orderId];
        // Order must exist
        if (orderState.requester == address(0)) revert OrderNotFound();

```

This way, there are no check which order actually wanted to place and which one wanted to be cancelled.

## Impact

The order which are wanted to be placed can get canceled, and the vice versa situation can happen for order cancel request.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We suggest to introduce new flag called `bool Cancel` in the `OrderState` struct. set this true when the order is wanted to cancel and handle the codes for fill and cancel. 

```solidity
    struct OrderState {
        // Account that requested the order
        address requester;
        // Amount of order token remaining to be used
        uint256 remainingOrder;
        // Total amount of received token due to fills
        uint256 received;
        //bool flag to notify the cancel or not
        bool Cancel; ------------------------------------->>> New flag.
    }
```
