# Malicious user can prevent treasury from getting fees in BuyOrderIssuer

## Summary

A malicious user can craft a buy order using the BuyOrderIssuer in a certain way which prevents the treasury from receiving fees at a low cost to the user.

## Vulnerability Detail

Both the BuyOrderIssuer and SellOrderProcessor are implemented similarly (in terms of fees distribution) in that the fees meant for the treasury are only sent when the entire order is fulfilled, or the order is partially fulfilled and the order is cancelled. The difference however, is that in SellOrderProcessor, the total `receivedAmount` of tokens will only be sent to the user for selling their `assetToken` at the same time as when the fees are sent to the treasury.

In BuyOrderIssuer, when an order is partially fulfilled, the `receivedAmount` of the `assetToken` is still minted to the user (meaning there is no waiting for the order to be completely fulfilled, or canceled). This can be seen with the implementation of `_fillOrderAccounting`:
```solidity
function _fillOrderAccounting(
    ...
) internal virtual override {
    // Calculate fees and mint asset
    _fillBuyOrder(orderRequest, orderId, orderState, fillAmount, receivedAmount);

    // Claim payment
    IERC20(orderRequest.paymentToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, fillAmount);
}
```
where `_fillBuyOrder` is defined as:
```solidity
function _fillBuyOrder(
    ...
) internal virtual {
    ...
    // Mint asset
    IMintBurn(orderRequest.assetToken).mint(orderRequest.recipient, receivedAmount);
}
```
This means that a malicious user can craft a buy order which will never be complete (so fees won't be sent to the treasury), yet will allow them to maximize their `receivedAmount` of the `assetToken`. Consider a simplified scenario where the market price for an `assetToken` is 100e18 USDC. Let's say the malicious user wants to craft a buy order where they want 5 of these tokens. Let's assume in this case, the total fees (fixed + variable) is 25e18 USDC. The user will then create a buy order in which they set 526e18 USDC as the `quantityIn`. This will result in 1e18 USDC to remain as the `orderState.remainingOrder` after the 5 tokens are purchased, meaning the order cannot be closed. This then means that the fees are never sent to the treasury, whereas the user has still received all their desired tokens.

## Impact

The treasury can be cheated out of receiving fees associated with performing a buy order as defined in the BuyOrderIssuer contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

During each call to `_fillBuyOrder`, the current `_feeState[orderId].feesEarned` should be sent to the treasury (minus whatever amount was previously sent). There should also be an added variable to the struct which accounts for the amount already sent, which will allow `feesEarned` to be referenced in other logic.
