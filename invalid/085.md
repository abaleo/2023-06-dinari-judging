# Arbitrage opportunity due to different behavior of `Fee` with low and high `inputValue`

## Summary

A ideal protocol implement constant ratio between `inputValue`  and `Fee` irrespective of ` inputValue ` is high or low. This gives equal opportunity to users and prevents possible arbitrage opportunity [uniswap- 0.3% ( irrespective of size of swap )]
Here a user will have to pay higher fee for same amount of `inputValue` if he request  `n` small order request equivalent to `inputValue`. This gives different arbitrage opportunity to Attackers and unnecessary waste of money of normal users.


## Vulnerability Detail

Suppose for a `tokenA` , `flatFee` is `f` and `percentageFeeRate ` is `p`. Now `Alice ` and `Bob` both want to request order of `inputValue= n`. Bob is smart contract developer and understands the protocol pretty well so he make order request of all amount at once and paid `BobTotalFee= f+ (n-f).p ` but `Alice` is a normal user who did transaction in x (>1 )times such that `n= x. a ` and she paid total fee `AliceTotalFee= x(f+ (a-f).p ) `  which is greater than `BobTotalFee`. `Bob ` can always find user like Alice and offer them to make order request on behalf of them and do arbitrage.
`diff`= ` x(f+ (a-f).p ) - f-(n-f).p`
       =   `xf + xap - xfp-f- xap + fp`
       =     ` xf -xfp -f +fp `
       =    ` f (x-1) (1-p)`
Alice paid `[ f(x-1)(1-p) ]` more fees than Alice for same amount of orderRequest.

## Impact

while protocol won't get much benefit from this as Attacker will make better offer in term of fees compared to protocol itself so user will prefer to contact  Attacker directly and then Attacker will interact with protocol
