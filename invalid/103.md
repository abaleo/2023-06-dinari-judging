# BridgedERC20: Transfer Restriction Bypass Vulnerability

## Summary
The BridgedERC20 contract inherits from an ERC20 implementation that does not call the _beforeTokenTransfer method in its transfer and transferFrom methods. This creates a vulnerability where an attacker can bypass the transfer restriction mechanism.
## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
The BridgedERC20 contract uses the _beforeTokenTransfer method to check if a transfer should be allowed based on restrictions provided by a transferRestrictor contract. However, this check can be bypassed due to the inherited ERC20 implementation not invoking _beforeTokenTransfer within the transfer and transferFrom methods. Therefore, any transfer operation performed through these methods will completely bypass any restrictions set by the transferRestrictor.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Override the transfer and transferFrom methods in the BridgedERC20 contract to explicitly call the _beforeTokenTransfer method before proceeding with the transfer:
```solidity
function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) public override returns (bool) {
    _beforeTokenTransfer(msg.sender, recipient, amount);
    return super.transfer(recipient, amount);
}

function transferFrom(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount) public override returns (bool) {
    _beforeTokenTransfer(sender, recipient, amount);
    return super.transferFrom(sender, recipient, amount);
}
```
This will ensure that all transfers, regardless of the method used, will respect the transfer restrictions and protect against unauthorized transfers.
