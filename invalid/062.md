# Griefing attack can DOS all new orders

## Summary
A griefing attack can ensure that no new orders are submitted to the Dinari `OrderProcessor.sol`. Since new order ids are computed via arbitrary inputs, anyone can frontrun a new `requestOrder()` call and create their own order with the same parameters. The attacker would then request a cancellation for the order to receive back their funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user wants to request a new order, they call `OrderProcessor.requestOrder()` with an `OrderRequest` struct and a `bytes32 salt`. The order id is then computed based off of these inputs:

```solidity
    function getOrderIdFromOrderRequest(OrderRequest memory orderRequest, bytes32 salt) public pure returns (bytes32) {
        return keccak256(
            abi.encode(
                ORDERREQUEST_TYPE_HASH,
                salt,
                orderRequest.recipient,
                orderRequest.assetToken,
                orderRequest.paymentToken,
                orderRequest.quantityIn
            )
        );
    }
```

Therefore, the malicious actor can create the exact same order id which will cause the actual user's order request to fail due to the following check:

`if (_orders[orderId].remainingOrder > 0) revert DuplicateOrder();`

## Impact
- DOS, preventing new orders from being requested

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The `keccak256` should include an encoding of `msg.sender` to ensure that the order creation cannot be frontrun.
