# Partially filled orders can get cancelled

## Summary
When Orders are partially filled, before the order is fulfilled, the requester can cancel the order

## Vulnerability Detail

An order only gets deleted when it's completely filled and fulfilled. But when partially filled, the `orderState.remainingOrder` and `orderState.received` just gets updated. At this state, it is still possible for the requester to cancel the order.
