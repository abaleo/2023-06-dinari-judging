# No way to stop massive cancel requests on bridge, leads to DoS

## Summary

Bridge works by handling events from blockchain.
Historically Bridge is full of risks, therefore sustain event stream is essential in bridges and there were many DoS attacks in bridges so far.
For creating order request, it's safe because it's not possible to send repeated request for remainingOrder check.
However in cancelling order request, there is no check that the cancellation is already requested.
These two actions are open to wild world, so we have to take care of them to make bridge safe.
This can co-operate with other offline attacks to make possiblity to DoS attack.
