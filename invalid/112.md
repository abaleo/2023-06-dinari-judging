# `requestCancel` can cause DoS attack

## Summary
`requestCancel` function can cause DoS(or DDoS) attack

## Vulnerability Detail
In OrderProcessor.sol, `requestCancel` function can be called as many times as possible while an order is active.
So the attacker can create an malicious smart contract that creates an order and loop requesting cancellation of that order right after creation. Since there can be a delay between cancellation request event and actual cancellation, there can be literally as many cancellation request events as possible.
This will cause off-chain operating service to handle all those events, which will consume off-chain resources and tons of gas fees for calling `cancelOrder` function even though it fails from 2nd time.
Moreover, if attack is done from multiple different wallets with different orders(DDoS), it will be very hard for the service to blacklist each one.

## Impact
This is a critical issue because based on the attack rate, the off-chain service will stop working while they process malicious event(which can be too many), also losing resources and uncountable gas fees.
For attackers, they will consume very little gas fees for calling `requestCancel` compared to operators calling `cancelOrder`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a status to `OrderState` so that it can reject cancellations if it's already requested once.
