# Fee setup does not impose proper restrictions that could lead to failure to execute the order

## Summary
Order fee configuration setup does not properly govern the applicable fee in a valid range for order amount. This could result in orders that are not executable by operators offchain.

There is no specific restriction for flat fee. And for the percentage fee rate, it could be 99.99% of the order value. 

But, when the fees are computed, the applicable value is a sum of both and does not make any sense for a viable trade setup for commercial reasons. As applicable is a sum of flat fee + percentage fee, the effective fee could be more that 99.99% of the over value.

## Vulnerability Detail
A very high fee rate and applicability of both forms of fee can potentially wipe out the commercial viability. The fee structure should be well thought out to compete with the centralised trading platforms that dominate the market, if not better to attract new customer base.

**POC**

```solidity
 dummyOrder = OrderProcessor.OrderRequest({
            recipient: user,
            assetToken: address(token),
            paymentToken: address(paymentToken),
            quantityIn: 50 ether,
            price: 0
        });

        (uint256 flatFee, uint256 percentageFee) =
            issuer.getFeesForOrder(dummyOrder.paymentToken, dummyOrder.quantityIn);

        console.log("dummyOrder.quantityIn", dummyOrder.quantityIn);
        console.log("flatFee", flatFee);
        console.log("percentageFee", percentageFee);
        console.log("total fee", percentageFee+flatFee);
        console.log("order after fee deduction", dummyOrder.quantityIn - (percentageFee+flatFee));
```
**Logs:**
  value 49999999999999000000
  percentage fee 999999999999999999
  dummyOrder.quantityIn 50000000000000000000
  flatFee 1000000
  percentageFee 49999999999998999950
  total fee 49999999999999999950
  order after fee deduction 50

## Impact
After applying fee, the order may not execute offchain due to low residual value. 

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dinari/blob/main/sbt-contracts/src/issuer/BuyOrderIssuer.sol#L106-L142

Note how the total fee causes the order to revert. Even, if it does not revert here and flows to offchain, the execution may not make commercial sense.
```solidity
function _requestOrderAccounting(OrderRequest calldata orderRequest, bytes32 orderId)
        internal
        virtual
        override
        returns (Order memory order)
    {
        // Determine fees
        (uint256 flatFee, uint256 percentageFee) = getFeesForOrder(orderRequest.paymentToken, orderRequest.quantityIn);
        uint256 totalFees = flatFee + percentageFee;
        // Fees must not exceed order input value
        if (totalFees >= orderRequest.quantityIn) revert OrderTooSmall();
```

## Tool used

Manual Review & Foundry testing

## Recommendation
The restriction for fee should be viewed from real world scenarios and should be adjusted to correct range of values, especially percentage fee, The platform should evaluate a valid range and should be enforced by smart contract rather then by admin alone.
Admin can configure fees with in prescribed ranges only.
