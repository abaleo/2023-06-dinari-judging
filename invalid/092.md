# There is no upper limit for _perOrderFee in OrderFees.sol

## Summary

In OrderFees.sol, there is a function to update _perOrderFee. But the problem is that there is no any upper limit allowing the owner to set any fee

## Vulnerability Detail

There are 2 types of fees in the project: _perOrderFee and _percentageFeeRate. They are both initialized in the constructor. There is a check for the _percentageFeeRate not being above 100% but there is no check for _perOrderFee. This also includes setFees() function that has no check for any upper limit

## Impact

High-risk as in the case of setting some ridiculous percent users will lose a lot of money

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add upper limit for _perOrderFee:

uint256 UPPER_LIMIT = ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT / 20 (5%)

if (_perOrderFee > UPPER_LIMIT) revert()
