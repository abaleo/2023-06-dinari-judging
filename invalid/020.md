# Buy/sell order slippage protection is not enforced

## Summary
User designated slippage is not enforced when submitting orders.

## Vulnerability Detail
When submitting an order request, individuals have the ability to specify the ```price``` variable to designate their maximum accepted slippage
```solidity
    struct OrderRequest {
        // Recipient of order fills
        address recipient;
        // Bridged asset token
        address assetToken;
        // Payment token
        address paymentToken;
        // Amount of incoming order token to be used for fills
        uint256 quantityIn;
        // price enquiry for the request
        //@audit this is the slippage protection paramater
        uint256 price;
    }
    function requestOrder(OrderRequest calldata orderRequest, bytes32 salt) public nonReentrant whenOrdersNotPaused {//..}
```
However this variable is not actually checked inside ```OrderProcessor#fillOrder``` when the order is processed, resulting in users having no slippage protection.

## Impact
User slippage protection is not implemented, leading to a loss of user funds. Especially since Arbitrum transactions are delayed by [rougly one week](https://developer.arbitrum.io/faqs/x-chain-faqs#:~:text=receive%20my%20funds%3F-,%E2%80%8B,about%20an%20hour%2C%20typically), it's likely users can lose a substantial amount of funds due to the extremely delayed market conditions.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Enforce proper slippage protection inside ```BuyOrderIssuer#_fillBuyOrder``` and  ```SellOrderProcessor#_fillOrderAccounting```.
