# Spam SELL orders can perform a DoS attack on off-chain services

## Summary

An attacker can create spam SELL orders to perform a denial-of-service (DoS) attack on the platform's off-chain operator/keeper services, causing the loss of the platform's expensive operating costs and all users' assets (legit buy/sell orders) may be finally devalued.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `OrderProcessor.requestOrder()` has the spam orders check that can easily bypass if the `orderRequest.quantityIn` >= 1 wei.

Furthermore, **the `SellOrderProcessor._requestOrderAccounting()` does not verify that the total received payment amount (after a sell order is completely filled) can eventually be less than the total selling fee.**

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dinari/blob/main/sbt-contracts/src/issuer/SellOrderProcessor.sol#L67-L88

For this reason, an attacker can deposit a minimal amount of a dShare token to open a spam SELL order (e.g., by passing the `orderRequest.quantityIn` >= 1 wei into the `requestOrder()` is enough to bypass the spam check described above).

Once the spam order is completely filled, the received payment amount will be less than the expected fee. Consequently, the protocol is forced to receive only a small fee.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dinari/blob/main/sbt-contracts/src/issuer/SellOrderProcessor.sol#L165-L166

The selling fee the protocol will receive may be pretty small (perhaps towards $0) since an attacker could deposit only 1 wei of the specified dShare token for the spam order, affecting the loss of the platform's operating costs (which can be more expensive than the received selling fee).

## Impact

An attacker can perform a denial-of-service (DoS) attack on the platform's off-chain operator/keeper services (or at least force the off-chain services to process expensive operating costs) by opening massive spam SELL orders.

Since the protocol will be deployed on the Arbitrum chain, the gas price/fee (the main cost of the attack) is considerably low.

As a result,
1. The platform will lose expensive operating costs (which can be more expensive than the received selling fee).
2. Since all legit buy/sell orders (of legitimate users) pending in the queue would be opened with `TIF.GTC` (Good Until Cancelled) ([Buy's TIF property](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dinari/blob/main/sbt-contracts/src/issuer/BuyOrderIssuer.sol#L135) and [Sell's TIF property](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dinari/blob/main/sbt-contracts/src/issuer/SellOrderProcessor.sol#L83)), the orders will be deferred to proceed for an extended period. Subsequently, the asset (dShare) or payment (USDC/USDT) tokens that users will eventually receive may be less than expected (devalued) due to the underlying assets' price slippage.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Restrict a **decent minimum SELL order** (`orderRequest.quantityIn`) for each underlying asset.
