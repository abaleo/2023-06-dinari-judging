# Funds could get stuck in the `DirectBuyIssuer.sol` contract which could be remain unaccessable by the Operator (`OPERATOR_ROLE`).

## Summary

Possibility of funds getting stuck in the `DirectBuyIssuer.sol` contract which could remain unaccessable by the Operator (addresses with `OPERATOR_ROLE`).

## Vulnerability Detail

It has been assumed by the developers that funds collected (escrowed amount) would be accessable (withdraw-able) by the operator, and to make sure, the functions `takeEscrow` and `returnEscrow` are created in the `DirectBuyIssuer` contract.

Though, it has been failed to note that the funds stored in `DirectBuyIssuer` contract and the one stored in treasury OR Buy/Sell Order contract are different, and one contract cannot access the parent contract's funds despite inheriting its functions and properties.

The code for transfer in both of these functions:

```solidity
IERC20(orderRequest.paymentToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
```

and

```solidity
IERC20(orderRequest.paymentToken).safeTransferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            amount
        );
```

can only access the funds from this contract, and not from other contracts. In case the escrow amount is returned from `returnEscrow`, it is not possible for the protocol to withdraw the complete amount or move collected amount to a separate account.

## Impact

Funds could get stuck and remain un-withdrawable.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a withdraw function for the operator to get the funds or redesign the fees (funds) collection and withdrawal process.
