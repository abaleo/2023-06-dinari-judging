# Incorrect orderType is set for Buy/Sell actions if the order type is `LIMIT` and not `MARKET`.

## Summary
In the case where user mentions the price at which he wishes to execute the order (LIMIT ORDER) then the Order of Type `LIMIT` is not set. Depending on how the monitoring service is developed, it can cause heavy losses to the protocol users.

## Vulnerability Detail

For BUY order, the order object is constructed this way:

```solidity
order = Order({
            recipient: orderRequest.recipient,
            assetToken: orderRequest.assetToken,
            paymentToken: orderRequest.paymentToken,
            // Buy order
            sell: false,
            // Market order
            orderType: OrderType.MARKET,
            assetTokenQuantity: 0,
            // Hold fees back from order amount
            paymentTokenQuantity: orderRequest.quantityIn - totalFees,
            price: orderRequest.price,
            // Good until cancelled
            tif: TIF.GTC,
            // Emit fees held back from order amount
            fee: totalFees
        });
```

where `orderType` is hard coded to `OrderType.MARKET,`, even if the trade price is specified by the user. So depending on how the monitoring service is created. It can place and execute order at the market price which can cause loss for the user.

Same issue exists in the `SellOrderProcessor.sol` as well.

```solidity
// Construct order
        order = Order({
            recipient: orderRequest.recipient,
            assetToken: orderRequest.assetToken,
            paymentToken: orderRequest.paymentToken,
            // Sell order
            sell: true,
            // Market order
            orderType: OrderType.MARKET,
            assetTokenQuantity: orderRequest.quantityIn,
            paymentTokenQuantity: 0,
            price: orderRequest.price,
            // Good until cancelled
            tif: TIF.GTC,
            fee: 0
        });
```

## Impact

Medium: User's `LIMIT` orders will be placed and executed at `MARKET` order.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

In case the price mentioned is non-zero or greater/lower than market price (for sell/buy respectively), make sure the `orderType` of `LIMIT` is set correctly and trade is processed accordingly by the service which monitors the emitted order events.
