# Incorrect funds will be transffered because of miscalculation in filling orders.

## Summary

In `_fillBuyOrder`, `fillOrder`, `_fillOrderAccounting`, the `fillAmount` is subtracted from `remainingOrder` instead of subtracting `receivedAmount` amount.

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability exists because `fillAmount` is subtracted from `orderState.remainingOrder` in place of the actual received amount.

```solidity
uint256 remainingOrder = orderState.remainingOrder - fillAmount;
```

When the correct way should be to subtract the received amount from the remaining ones, in such way:

```solidity
uint256 remainingOrder = orderState.remainingOrder - receivedAmount;
```

I also believe that incorrect amount of tokens will be burned in this line because of the same reason.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Subtract the received amount instead:

```solidity
uint256 remainingOrder = orderState.remainingOrder - receivedAmount;
```

Also burn the correct token amount this way:

```solidity
IMintBurn(orderRequest.assetToken).burn(receivedAmount);
```
