# If a user sells small asset quantity not coverable total fees, he won't receive money.

## Summary
If a user sells small asset quantity not coverable total fees, he won't receive money.

## Vulnerability Detail
If a user sells small asset quantity not coverable fees (flatFee + percentageFee), he won't receive money.
In _requestOrderAccounting() function on SellOrderProcessor contract, there is no checking if he can receive the amount larger than total fees (flatFee + percentageFee).
```solidity
    /// @inheritdoc OrderProcessor
    function _requestOrderAccounting(OrderRequest calldata orderRequest, bytes32 orderId)
        internal
        virtual
        override
        returns (Order memory order)
    {
        // Accumulate initial flat fee obligation
        _feesEarned[orderId] = getFlatFeeForOrder(orderRequest.paymentToken);

        // Construct order
        order = Order({
            recipient: orderRequest.recipient,
            assetToken: orderRequest.assetToken,
            paymentToken: orderRequest.paymentToken,
            // Sell order
            sell: true,
            // Market order
            orderType: OrderType.MARKET,
            assetTokenQuantity: orderRequest.quantityIn,
            paymentTokenQuantity: 0,
            price: orderRequest.price,
            // Good until cancelled
            tif: TIF.GTC,
            fee: 0
        });

        // Escrow asset for sale
        IERC20(orderRequest.assetToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), orderRequest.quantityIn);
    }
```
If total fees is larger than total received, then he won't receive money and so he will complain about it.
```solidity
    /// @dev Distribute proceeds and fees
    function _distributeProceeds(address paymentToken, address recipient, uint256 totalReceived, uint256 feesEarned)
        private
    {
        // Check if accumulated fees are larger than total received
        uint256 proceeds = 0;
        uint256 collection = 0;
        if (totalReceived > feesEarned) {
            // Take fees from total received before distributing
            proceeds = totalReceived - feesEarned;
            collection = feesEarned;
        } else {
            // If accumulated fees are larger than total received, then no proceeds go to recipient
            collection = totalReceived;
        }

        // Transfer proceeds to recipient
        if (proceeds > 0) {
            IERC20(paymentToken).safeTransfer(recipient, proceeds);
        }
        // Transfer fees to treasury
        if (collection > 0) {
            IERC20(paymentToken).safeTransfer(treasury, collection);
        }
    }
```
## Impact
If a user sells small asset quantity not coverable fees(flatFee + percentageFee), he won't receive money and so he will complain about it.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Need to calculate the estimated receiving amount using orderRequest.price and check if it can cover total fees (flatFee + percentageFee) in _requestOrderAccounting() function on SellOrderProcessor contract. If it doesn't cover total fees, it should be reverted.
```solidity
    /// @inheritdoc OrderProcessor
    function _requestOrderAccounting(OrderRequest calldata orderRequest, bytes32 orderId)
        internal
        virtual
        override
        returns (Order memory order)
    {
        // Accumulate initial flat fee obligation
        _feesEarned[orderId] = getFlatFeeForOrder(orderRequest.paymentToken);
        uint256 estimatedAmount = orderRequest.quantityIn * orderRequest.price; // it's only example..
        uint256 collection = getPercentageFeeForOrder(estimatedAmount);
        uint256 totalFees = _feesEarned[orderId] + collection;
        if (totalFees >= estimatedAmount) revert OrderTooSmall();

        // Construct order
        order = Order({
        ...
    }
```
