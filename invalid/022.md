# Treasury fees can be locked in the contract indefinitely from partially fulfilled orders

## Summary
Treasury fees from partially filled orders can be locked in the contract since they require either the order owner to cancel it, or the order to be fully fulfilled. Certain market conditions can make both unfeasible, which will result in fees being locked indefinitely. 
## Vulnerability Detail
Fees are only payed to the treasury when orders are closed. Orders are only closed if the user who initiated the order cancels it, or the order is fully filled by the operator. Orders can be partially filled by an operator,  and the fees will be accrued based on the percentage of the total order fulfilled. However, the fees still wont be sent until the order is complete. 

```solidity
function _fillBuyOrder(
        OrderRequest calldata orderRequest,
        bytes32 orderId,
        OrderState memory orderState,
        uint256 fillAmount,
        uint256 receivedAmount
    ) internal virtual {
        FeeState memory feeState = _feeState[orderId];
        uint256 remainingOrder = orderState.remainingOrder - fillAmount;
        // @audit If order is done, close order and transfer fees
        if (remainingOrder == 0) {
            _closeOrder(orderId, orderRequest.paymentToken, feeState.remainingPercentageFees + feeState.feesEarned);
        } else {
            //@audit accumulate fees based on the percentage of the order filled
            uint256 collection = 0;
            if (feeState.remainingPercentageFees > 0) {
                // fee = remainingPercentageFees * fillAmount / remainingOrder
                collection = PrbMath.mulDiv(feeState.remainingPercentageFees, fillAmount, orderState.remainingOrder);
            }
            // Update fee state
            if (collection > 0) {
                _feeState[orderId].remainingPercentageFees = feeState.remainingPercentageFees - collection;
                _feeState[orderId].feesEarned = feeState.feesEarned + collection;
            }
        }
    //..
}
```
An issue exists in the case of partially fulfilled orders. For instance, if an operator partially fulfilled 90% of an order when the market conditions were favorable then those fees on the 90% would still be locked in the contract. If the market conditions became unfavorable, then in order for the treasury to get the accumulated fees either the operator would be forced to fulfill an unfavorable trade, or the user would have to cancel the rest of their order. There can be no guarantee that either will happen so the treasury fees will be locked indefinitely.

## Impact
The treasury will not receive its due fees which can be locked in the contract indefinitely.

## Recommendation
Either accrue the fees in the contract and give the treasurer a function to collect them, or send accrued fees after each partial fulfillment.
