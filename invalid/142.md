# Users cant cancel orders because the cancelOrder() function always reverts.

## Summary
Users cant cancel orders because the cancelOrder() function always reverts.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user wants to cancel his order, should request a cancel order, and then operator execute the request by calling cancelOrder() function but issue is function first delete order state and then transfer tokens by using order state.

## Impact
Orders never can be canceled that's can lead to losing funds.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function cancelOrder(OrderRequest calldata orderRequest, bytes32 salt, string calldata reason)
        external
        nonReentrant
        onlyRole(OPERATOR_ROLE)
    {
        bytes32 orderId = getOrderIdFromOrderRequest(orderRequest, salt);
        OrderState memory orderState = _orders[orderId];
        // Order must exist
        if (orderState.requester == address(0)) revert OrderNotFound();


        // Notify order cancelled
        emit OrderCancelled(orderId, orderRequest.recipient, reason);


        // Clear order state
        delete _orders[orderId];
        _numOpenOrders--;


        // Move tokens
        _cancelOrderAccounting(orderRequest, orderId, orderState);
    }
```
