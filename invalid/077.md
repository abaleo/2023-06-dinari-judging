# perOrderFlatFee can revert due to overflow

## Summary
OrderFees defines `perOrderFlatFee` as `uint64` which can revert if overflown
## Vulnerability Detail
The flat order fee in `OrderFees.sol` is defined as `uint64`. For tokens with 18 decimals, this would revert due to overflow if fee is more than 18.45 of that token. 
```
2**64 = 10**19.26 = 18.4467 * 10**18
```
## Impact
### Medium
If a particular token's value drops in the market to a point where the owner decides to increase the flat fee, they would not be able to increase it to more than 18.45 of the tokens amount. 
## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dinari/blob/main/sbt-contracts/src/issuer/OrderFees.sol#L30
### Contract: src/issuer/OrderFees
```solidity
L30: uint64 public perOrderFee;
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Since the contract only has 3 variables each uint64, `perOrderFlatFee` can be defined as uint128 and would still fit in a single storage slot without costing any more gas.
