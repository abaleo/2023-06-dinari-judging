# order has no expiration time and slippage protection

## Summary

The type of order in this protocol is hardcoded as the MARKET price and TIF.GTC expiration time. 
The MARKET price means that stock price fluctuations can have an impact on the number of tokens received, and for unpopular stocks, the order can last a long time.
The TIF.GTC expiration time, means that there is no expiration time, only cancellation can close the order.
The combination of these two factors can have an impact on user funds when the stock market price fluctuates sharply

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
        order = Order({
            recipient: orderRequest.recipient,
            assetToken: orderRequest.assetToken,
            paymentToken: orderRequest.paymentToken,
            // Buy order
            sell: false,
            // Market order
            orderType: OrderType.MARKET,
            assetTokenQuantity: 0,
            // Hold fees back from order amount
            paymentTokenQuantity: orderRequest.quantityIn - totalFees,
            price: orderRequest.price,
            // Good until cancelled
            tif: TIF.GTC,
            // Emit fees held back from order amount
            fee: totalFees
        });

        // Construct order
        order = Order({
            recipient: orderRequest.recipient,
            assetToken: orderRequest.assetToken,
            paymentToken: orderRequest.paymentToken,
            // Sell order
            sell: true,
            // Market order
            orderType: OrderType.MARKET,
            assetTokenQuantity: orderRequest.quantityIn,
            paymentTokenQuantity: 0,
            price: orderRequest.price,
            // Good until cancelled
            tif: TIF.GTC,
            fee: 0
        });
```

As you can see from the code, the parameters are hard-coded and cannot be changed

## Impact

When the stock market price fluctuates, it will have an impact on the user's funds, and there is no protection
