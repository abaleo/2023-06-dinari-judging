# Order fill process does not check minReceived

## Summary
When filling an order, the fillAmount (asset or payment token) and receivedAmount (shares) are calculated off-chain.
While full fillAmount is the same as the orderAmount, receivedAmount can differ. 
There are some checks in place for fillAmount but not for receivedAmount.
It's the same as inputting a minReceived/ expectedReceive value when swapping assets as uniswap
## Vulnerability Detail

Fill amount is checked for the following:

An additional check is that full fillAmount eventually equals the orderAmount, otherwise the user is able to cancel the order and receive the remaining amount. 

When submitting an order, the user specifies the orderAmount (of paymentToken) and the price. 
It is then up to the off-chain component to determine what the amountReceived will be. 
The problem is, due to the fact that the user can't specify a min expected amount to receive, the user is subjected to what the off-chain component calculates. 
This could result to the user receiving less than expected.
## Impact
When an order is filled, the user could receive less than expected.

## Recommendation
implement a minReceived value that is checked when the order is being filled.
