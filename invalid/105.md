# Potential for DoS Attack in OrderProcessor.sol

## Summary
There is a potential for a DoS attack in `OrderProcessor.sol` contract due to a front-running vulnerability associated with the generation of orderIds. An attacker can manipulate the order request function to block the execution of orders for specific users.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `OrderProcessor.sol`, each transaction uses a hashed value of the `orderRequest` and `salt` as the `orderId`. If an `orderId` is identical to a previously submitted order, the transaction is reverted.

A malicious user can exploit this by watching the mempool for `requestOrder` transactions and then front-running with identical parameters. As a result, the malicious user preempts the orderId intended for the original user, causing the original user's transaction to be reverted. The attacker can then promptly send a cancel request to retrieve their funds, effectively blocking a specific user's transaction at the cost of a small gas fee.

## Impact
This vulnerability not only inconveniences users by blocking their transactions but also undermines the trust in the protocol, potentially discouraging user engagement and adoption.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To prevent this front-running vulnerability, it is recommended to include a parameter associated with the transaction requester, such as `msg.sender`, in the generation of `orderId`. This change ensures that `orderIds` are unique to each user and transaction, mitigating the risk of order preemption and transaction blocking.
