# Lack of slippage protection in _requestOrderAccounting() exposes user funds to losses

## Summary

When creating an order  in `_requestOrderAccounting` in `BuyOrderIssuer` there is no **slippage** protection for user's funds. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability stems from the Operator's reliance on listening to `OrderRequested` events triggered by users. The Operator's responsibility is to purchase stocks on behalf of the user, but the fulfillment process may encounter unexpected delays due to off-chain factors. Such delays could arise for various reasons: circuit breaks, off-chain network congestion, compliance and regulatory checks, external market events or external service dependencies.

## Impact

Exposes users to the risk of financial loss if the fulfillment of their orders takes longer than expected due to off-chain factors. Users may encounter adverse price movements or market fluctuations during the extended processing time, resulting in **slippage** and potential losses.

```solidity
order = Order({           
  recipient: orderRequest.recipient,
  assetToken: orderRequest.assetToken,
  paymentToken: orderRequest.paymentToken,
  sell: false,
  orderType: OrderType.MARKET, 
  assetTokenQuantity: 0,
  paymentTokenQuantity: orderRequest.quantityIn - totalFees,
  price: orderRequest.price,
  tif: TIF.GTC,
  fee: totalFees
});
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Incorporate slippage tolerance mechanisms that account for price fluctuations during delayed order fulfillment. This can be achieved by setting a maximum acceptable price deviation from the order's original intended execution price.
