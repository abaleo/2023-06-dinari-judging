# Blacklisted `accounts` can still send and receive tokens.

## Summary
`Blacklisted` accounts can still send and receive tokens because it is not checked before transfers.
## Vulnerability Detail
In `TransferRestrictor.sol` the function `requireNotRestricted()` is used to ensure that a blacklisted account cannot send or receive tokens.
```solidity
 function requireNotRestricted(address from, address to) external view virtual {
        // Check if either account is restricted
        if (blacklist[from] || blacklist[to]) {
            revert AccountRestricted();
        }
        // Otherwise, do nothing
    }
```
This function also is used in `BridgedERC20._beforeTokenTransfer()` with some additional checks.
```solidity
 function _beforeTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256) internal virtual override {
        // Restrictions ignored for minting and burning
        // If transferRestrictor is not set, no restrictions are applied
        if (from == address(0) || to == address(0) || address(transferRestrictor) == address(0)) {
            return;
        }

        // Check transfer restrictions
        transferRestrictor.requireNotRestricted(from, to);
    }
```
The issue here is that calls to `_beforeTokenTransfer()` or `requireNotRestricted()` are not done before transfers, especially between the users and protocol to prevent blacklisted accounts from transferring.

## Impact
Blacklisted accounts can still interact with the protocol leading to unexpected security risks.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Calls to `_beforeTokenTransfer()` or `requireNotRestricted()` should be added to vital functions to ensure safety and prevent `blacklisted` users from calling them.
