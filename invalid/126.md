# Fees with low decimals will be truncated to zero

## Summary

If the protocol decides to allow a low decimal token like (EURS, 2 decimals) for example, protocol may not receive any fees because fees may be truncated to zero.

## Vulnerability Detail

Fees are calculated in OrderFees.sol, and the fees can be converted according to the decimal place of the tokens.

```solidity
    function flatFeeForOrder(address token) external view returns (uint256 flatFee) {
        // Query token decimals from token contract
        // This could revert if the token is not IERC20Metadata
        uint8 decimals = IERC20Metadata(token).decimals();
        // Decimals over 18 are not supported
        if (decimals > 18) revert DecimalsTooLarge();
        // Start with base flat fee
        flatFee = perOrderFee;
        // Adjust flat fee to token decimals if necessary
>       if (decimals < 18 && flatFee != 0) {
>          flatFee /= 10 ** (18 - decimals);
        }
    }
```

For example, lets say flatFee is 1e16 (1%) and the decimal of the token being used (USDC) is 1e6. 1e16 / 10**(18-6) = 1e16/1e12 = 1e4. Fees in USDC will be 1e4 (1%, properly converted into USDC decimals). However, if the decimal is any lower, like EURS, then the same conversion will result in zero amount.

Take EURS with 2 decimals. 1e16 flat fee will be divided by 10**(18-2) = 1e16 / 1e16 will be 0. 1% of EURS fee will be 0.

Also, the same issue will occur if the flat fee is of an extremely low percentage, ie 0.0001% or 1e12. If fee is extremely low, then using USDC as an example, 1e12 / 10**(18-6) = 0.

## Impact

Fees will not be calculated properly for tokens with extremely low decimal places or if base fee itself is extremely low.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Recommend having a minimum flat fee and making sure that tokens with low decimal places will not be accepted in the protocol.
