# Blacklist mechanism is not in place

## Summary
Docs mention that the project aims to implement a blacklist where addresses are restricted from transfers.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dinari/blob/main/sbt-contracts/src/TransferRestrictor.sol#L9
and 2.1 of the whitelist:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dinari/blob/main/sbt-contracts/whitepaper-v1-draft.pdf

This is not implemented hence not working.
## Vulnerability Detail
Following restricts transfers if included in the blacklist:

It's only implementation is here:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dinari/blob/4851cb7ebc86a7bc26b8d0d399a7dd7f9520f393/sbt-contracts/src/BridgedERC20.sol#L127-L135

`_beforeTokenTransfer()` is not implemented anywhere and solmate's ERC20 transfer functions are not overridden to include it.
## Impact
Blacklist function does not work
