# Adding storage gaps for future version upgrades

## Summary

The `OrderProcessor` and `BuyOrderIssuer` are base contracts of other child contracts. They should [add storage gaps](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/writing-upgradeable#storage-gaps), guaranteeing their future versions (`OrderProcessor` and `BuyOrderIssuer`) will be upgradeable without conflicting with the storage layout of child contracts.

## Vulnerability Detail

The [`OrderProcessor`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dinari/blob/main/sbt-contracts/src/issuer/OrderProcessor.sol#L37) is a base contract of:
	1. [`BuyOrderIssuer`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dinari/blob/main/sbt-contracts/src/issuer/BuyOrderIssuer.sol#L16) child contract
	2. [`DirectBuyIssuer`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dinari/blob/main/sbt-contracts/src/issuer/DirectBuyIssuer.sol#L28) child contract
	3. [`SellOrderProcessor`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dinari/blob/main/sbt-contracts/src/issuer/SellOrderProcessor.sol#L17) child contract

Whereas the [`BuyOrderIssuer`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dinari/blob/main/sbt-contracts/src/issuer/BuyOrderIssuer.sol#L16) can be a base contract of the [`DirectBuyIssuer`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dinari/blob/main/sbt-contracts/src/issuer/DirectBuyIssuer.sol#L28) child contract.

## Impact

Without adding the storage gaps in advance, the future version upgrades of the `OrderProcessor` and `BuyOrderIssuer` may conflict with the storage layout of the child contracts.

Subsequently, the platform's contracts [may not be upgradeable](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/writing-upgradeable#storage-gaps) as planned.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Recommend [adding storage gaps](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/writing-upgradeable#storage-gaps) to the `OrderProcessor` and `BuyOrderIssuer` base contracts to guarantee future version upgrades as expected.
