# Orders may be vulnerable to stablecoin depegging

## Summary
Depending on the implementation of the operator, ```BuyOrderIssuer#_fillBuyOrder()``` may be minting 1-to-1 based on the number of stablecoin received. This would allow users to drain the contract of a substantial amount of funds if a coin were to depeg.
## Vulnerability Detail
In description of the order processing functionality, the whitepaper mentions that when submitting an order: 

> "users specify an asset token (the dShare) and a payment token (e.g. USDC). A buy order takes payment token and gives dShares when filled. A sell order takes dShares and gives payment token when filled. dShares are minted or burned by the order processor as the order is filled". 

When an operator receives an order request, they will call the following ```OrderProcessor#fillOrder()``` function. The ```receivedAmount``` parameter is indicated by the comments to be the "amount of received token". If I were to fill a buy order with 10 USDC(10e6), then this value would ideally be 10e18 (scaled to 18 decimals). If i were to fill a buy order with 10 USDT (10e18), then this value would likewise be 10e18 as well.
```solidity
    /// @notice Fill an order
    /// @param orderRequest Order request to fill
    /// @param salt Salt used to generate unique order ID
    /// @param fillAmount Amount of order token to fill
    /// @param receivedAmount Amount of received token <---------------------- @audit
    /// @dev Only callable by operator
    //@audit additional functions should have the whenOrdersNotPaused modifier
    function fillOrder(OrderRequest calldata orderRequest, bytes32 salt, uint256 fillAmount, uint256 receivedAmount)
        external
        nonReentrant
        onlyRole(OPERATOR_ROLE)
```

This function will later call ```BuyOrderIssuer#_fillBuyOrder``` with the same ```receivedAmount``` parameter which will be the number of dShares to mint (10 USDT/USDC := 10 dShares)
```solidity
    function _fillBuyOrder(
        OrderRequest calldata orderRequest,
        bytes32 orderId,
        OrderState memory orderState,
        uint256 fillAmount,
        uint256 receivedAmount
    ) internal virtual {
        FeeState memory feeState = _feeState[orderId];
        uint256 remainingOrder = orderState.remainingOrder - fillAmount;

        if (remainingOrder == 0) {
            _closeOrder(orderId, orderRequest.paymentToken, feeState.remainingPercentageFees + feeState.feesEarned);
        } else {
           //..
        }

        // Mint asset
        //@audit if usdt or usdc depegs then this will cause issues
        //an oracle should be used here
        IMintBurn(orderRequest.assetToken).mint(orderRequest.recipient, receivedAmount);
    }
```
Likewise, with the 10 dShares that i bought with 10 USDC, I can create a sell order and receive 10 USDT in exchange. This is essentially a pegged one-to-one exchange between the USDT and USDC. The issue is if either de-pegs from their dollar price, then a malicious user will be able to drain the contract.

Example:
Contract balance: 100 USDT 100USDC ($200)
1. USDC depegs down to $0.95 as it happened in March 2023, contract value goes down to $195
2. Alice deposits 100 USDC($95) in exchange for 100 dShares 
3. Alice Withdraws 100 USDT($100) and burns 100 dShares, profiting $5
4. contract balance is now 0 USDT 200 USDC with a total value of $190, alice has stolen $5 from the vault

 
## Impact
Depending on how serious the depeg, a malicious can drain the vault of a substantial amount of funds.

Manual Review

## Note on the severity
In a private conversation the sponsor has indicated that the operator is responsible for doing proper stablecoin/USD price conversions offchain.

However since the operator code isnt in scope and there is some indication in the code comments that the stablecoin exchange is one-to-one, im forced to assume this is a High severity issue.
```solidity
    /// @param receivedAmount Amount of received token 
```


## Recommendation
consider adding some onchain oracle checks for the price of the assets. Use this value to mint an appropriate number of shares when submitting fulfilling a buy request. Same for sell requests, an oracle should be used to determine the number of tokens received for dShares burned.
