# A restricted Address isn't entirely restricted

## Summary
A restricted address can play the ```BURNER_ROLE```

## Vulnerability Detail
The contract / protocol intends to implement a strict and controlled burning pathway. This can be seen via its implementation of ```BURNER_ROLE``` . However, this can be bypassed.

## Impact

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function testRestrictedCanBurn()public {
        token.grantRole(token.MINTER_ROLE(), address(this));
        token.mint(address(1), 200);
        restrictor.restrict(address(1));
        vm.prank(address(1));
        bool val = token.transfer(address(0),100);
        console.log("0AdressBal",token.balanceOf(address(0)), token.balanceOf(address(1)));
        // assert address(1) can Transfer
        assertEq(token.balanceOf(address(1)), 200 - 100);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dinari/blob/main/sbt-contracts/src/BridgedERC20.sol#L127C5-L136C6

in ```_beforeTokenTransfer()``` implement 
```solidity
if (to == address(0)) { require(msg.sender == (address(burner)));}
```
