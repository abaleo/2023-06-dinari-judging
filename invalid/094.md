# Check for upper limit for _percentageFeeRate doesn't create necessary protection

## Summary

In OrderFees.sol, there is _percentageFeeRate initialization  in the constructor and the check that it's no more than 100%. However, this check is not enough and it doesn't protect users from setting some huge fee percent

## Vulnerability Detail

There is _percentageFeeRate parameter in the protocol that is set in the constructor and then can be updated via setFees() function. The check in the constructor only checks whether it's more than 100% but that's not enough because it can be 90% and it's still ridiculous fee amount to pay. In this case, it's better to set some upper limit that cannot be bypassed

## Impact

If the owner decides to set some huge fee percent, the users will lose lots of money and the fact that such fees can be set creates distrust to the protocol

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add upper limit such as:

uint256 UPPER_LIMIT = ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT / 20

if (_percentageFeeRate > UPPER_LIMIT) revert()
