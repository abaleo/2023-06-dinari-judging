# Lack of zero-address validation in various functions

## Summary
Lack of zero-address checks might lead to inoperable contract if parameter setings are not handled carefully.

## Vulnerability Detail

A number of functions in the codebase do not revert if the zero address is passed in for a parameter that should not be set to zero.
The following parameters do not have zero-address validation:
- `owner` & `transferRestrictor_` in BridgedERC20.constructor()
- `restrictor` in BridgedERC20.setTransferRestrictor()
- `owner`, `orderFees_` in OrderProcessor.initialize()
- `fees` in OrderProcessor.setOrderFees()

## Impact

Either one of the parameters were accidentally set to address zero would cause huge impact to the protocol. The damage includes ownership lost, non-transferable tokens, unable to do fee accounting.

## Recommendation

Add zero-address validation for the parameters listed above. Review input validation across components.
