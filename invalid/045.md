# The orderId is not deleted when the `requestCancel` function successful executes, which keeps the order alive for further actions.

## Summary

In `OrderProcessor.requestCancel` does not delete `orderId` from the `_orders` mapping 

## Vulnerability Detail

When `OrderProcessor.requestCancel` is executed the `orderId` from the `_orders` mapping is not deleted, which keeps the order alive for execution later.

It is clearly expected that `orderId` should be removed from the mapping and total active orders (`_numOpenOrders`) be reduced (decrement) when a order is closed, removed or cancelled.

The below function fails to do it.

```solidity
    function requestCancel(OrderRequest calldata orderRequest, bytes32 salt) external {
        bytes32 orderId = getOrderIdFromOrderRequest(orderRequest, salt);
        address requester = _orders[orderId].requester;
        // Order must exist
        if (requester == address(0)) revert OrderNotFound();
        // Only requester can request cancellation
        if (requester != msg.sender) revert NotRequester();

        // Send cancel request to bridge
        emit CancelRequested(orderId, orderRequest.recipient);
    }
```

## Impact

Keeping a order alive could have high impact depending on how the order monitoring system is designed.

## Recommendation
Change the function to:

```solidity
    function requestCancel(
        OrderRequest calldata orderRequest,
        bytes32 salt
    ) external {
        bytes32 orderId = getOrderIdFromOrderRequest(orderRequest, salt);
        address requester = _orders[orderId].requester;
        // Order must exist
        if (requester == address(0)) revert OrderNotFound();
        // Only requester can request cancellation
        if (requester != msg.sender) revert NotRequester();

        delete _orders[orderId];
        _numOpenOrders--;

        // Send cancel request to bridge
        emit CancelRequested(orderId, orderRequest.recipient);
    }
```
