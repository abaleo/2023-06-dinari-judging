# A Blacklisted account can become the owner & restrict other users

## Summary
Although the previous owner is trusted but a simple mistake can create critical exploits in the future.

`TransferRestrictor` contract is used to " maintains a single `owner` who can add or remove accounts from `blacklist`". Due to lack of access control in the constructor to check if the new owner is blacklisted or not, the blacklisted account can become the new owner & restrict the operations of users by blacklisting them or by making already blacklisted address back to normal.

## Vulnerability Detail

Ownership of the contract can be transferred to a blacklisted address as there is no check to ensure if the new owner is blacklisted or not.

```solidity
    /// ------------------ Initialization ------------------ ///

    constructor(address owner) {
        _transferOwnership(owner);
    }
```
## Impact

A malicious address which had been previously blacklisted by the owner due to malpractice can now be operational again & carry out its functions.
Or a perfectly valid address can be blacklisted by the owner & will be unable to send & receive tokens. This in turn would break the trust of the user in the protocol & can lead to loss of funds as the user won't be able to buy, sell or cancel his/her order as per their need.

## Recommendation
A simple check can solve this issue

```solidity

    constructor(address owner) {
         if (blacklist[owner] == false) {
               _transferOwnership(owner);
    }
}

```
