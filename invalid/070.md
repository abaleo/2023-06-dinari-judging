# The protocol will pay double of the directBuy order amount if the order escrow is fully taken then fully fulfilled

## Summary

The protocol will pay double of the directBuy order amount if the order escrow is fully taken then fully fulfilled

## Vulnerability Detail

- In `DirectBuyIssuer` contract: the protocol will pay double of the directBuy order amount if any operator takes the full escrow payment of any directBuy order then the same order is fully fulfilled by the same operator or another one.
- Let's look at the following scenario,imaginging that we have two operators: `operator#1` & `operator#2` :

  1. `operator#1` calls `takeEscrow` function to take the whole escrow of a specific directBuy order;so by doing this, the `getOrderEscrow[orderId]` of that order will be updated to zero:  
     [`getOrderEscrow[orderId] = escrow - amount;`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dinari/blob/4851cb7ebc86a7bc26b8d0d399a7dd7f9520f393/sbt-contracts/src/issuer/DirectBuyIssuer.sol#L65)
  2. assuming that the same operator (`operator#1`) wants to fully fulfill that same order **by mistake**, so in `_fillOrderAccounting` function there's the following check before filling the order and transferring the payment to the operator :  
     [`if (fillAmount > orderState.remainingOrder - escrow) revert AmountTooLarge();`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dinari/blob/4851cb7ebc86a7bc26b8d0d399a7dd7f9520f393/sbt-contracts/src/issuer/DirectBuyIssuer.sol#L123)  
     so `operator#1` was able to bypass this check and proceed with filling the order, so at the end of this transaction `operator#1` will be having the `getOrderEscrow[orderId]`(which is `order.paymentTokenQuantity`) + fillAmount (which is `order.paymentTokenQuantity`)= double of order amount.

  3. Assuming that each operator is **aware** of the orders that he has taken all its escrow ,so he will not attempt to fill it **maliciously** or **by mistake**; another possible scenario might happen when another operator tries to fill the order that has its escrow taken:
     now repeating point#2 but with `operator#2`!

## Impact

The protocol will be paying more of its `paymentToken` (USDC or USDT) than its balance,which will lead to orders not being able to be filled or cancelled due to insufficient protocol balance.

## Code Snippet

- In `DirectBuyIssuer.sol`/ `takeEscrow` function: [L65](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dinari/blob/4851cb7ebc86a7bc26b8d0d399a7dd7f9520f393/sbt-contracts/src/issuer/DirectBuyIssuer.sol#L65)

```solidity
Line 65:  getOrderEscrow[orderId] = escrow - amount;
```

- In `DirectBuyIssuer.sol`/ `_fillOrderAccounting` function: [L123](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dinari/blob/4851cb7ebc86a7bc26b8d0d399a7dd7f9520f393/sbt-contracts/src/issuer/DirectBuyIssuer.sol#L123)

```solidity
Line 123: if (fillAmount > orderState.remainingOrder - escrow) revert AmountTooLarge();
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- In `DirectBuyIssuer.sol`/ `takeEscrow` function: prevent operators from taking the full amount of the order's escrow by updating the following check:
  ```solidity
  Line 62: if (amount >= escrow) revert AmountTooLarge();
  ```
